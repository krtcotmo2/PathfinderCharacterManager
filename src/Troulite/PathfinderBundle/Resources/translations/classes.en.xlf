The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and  spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible—such  mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise  above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the  wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric  knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities  of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical  study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility,  reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards  prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes,  empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.</p><p><b>Role</b>: While universalist wizards might study to prepare  themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools  of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus.  Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible  and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger.</p>]]></target>

Far more than mere thugs, these  skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning  hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering  monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies.

spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle
 magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw 
forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever 
threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched 
souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, 
gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever 
greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful 
spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they 
choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their 
abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their 
fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule 
their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and
 breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, 
and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life 
itself.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored spells
 frequently, making them powerful battle mages. As they become familiar 
with a specific and ever-widening set of spells, sorcerers often 
discover new and versatile ways of making use of magics other 
spellcasters might overlook. Their bloodlines also grant them additional
 abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers are ever quite alike.</p>]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[<p>In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose.
 Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests 
preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. 
Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the 
divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the 
magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and 
philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the 
knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share 
similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the 
divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others
 judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and 
corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these 
paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods 
themselves.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: More than capable of upholding the honor of their 
deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. 
Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of 
their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies' prowess 
in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to 
companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all 
clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast 
majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate 
themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle, death,
 justice, or knowledge—free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM 
if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)</p>
<p><b>Alignment</b>: A cleric's alignment must be within one step of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.</p>]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[<p>The loremaster is a gatherer and keeper of secrets. He is often 
obsessed by the written word, with cryptic and arcane lore serving as 
his devoted mistress. Holding to the adage that knowledge is power, the 
loremaster often forsakes material wealth and personal glory for rare or
 unusual information, an endless quest that brings him ever closer to 
his unattainable goal: perfection through edification. Often rejecting 
what he views as the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of 
his short-sighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only 
worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might. After 
all, wealth is spent, passions fade, and the power of the body is 
limited by age, while the mind's capacity to grow greater with time is 
infinite.</p>
<p>The loremaster class holds little appeal for non-spellcasters—indeed,
 before one can devote a life to the studies and traditions of the 
loremaster, a character must first master several spells of the school 
of divination. Most loremasters begin their paths as <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">clerics</a> or <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">wizards</a>, but any character capable of casting enough divination spells can, eventually, become a loremaster.</p>
<p><b>Role</b>: Loremasters' lives are spent in study, research, and 
fieldwork. While the first two lend themselves to the loremaster's 
reputation as a bookish recluse, the latter oftentimes forces a 
loremaster to seek out the aid of adventurers who, through a mutually 
beneficial arrangement, might provide a degree of protection to the 
scholar while he seeks whatever knowledge he is after. For his part, the
 loremaster provides a wealth of information and arcane firepower to a 
party. Some loremasters actively deride those of their kind who fear to 
leave the safety of the temple or library, pointing out that only old 
lore can be discovered in books—new lore must be sought out in the 
world. These more active loremasters might join up with an adventuring 
party for the benefit of the journey, content with whatever knowledge 
might be picked up along the way.</p>]]></target>
