The character's abilities, mind, and spirit remain unaffected; only the character's sex changes. If the character's saving throw is a natural 1, the item actually removes all gender from the wearer, giving him an androgynous, neutered appearance. The change is permanent unless undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic takes effect, the belt can be removed without effort. A creature can only be affected by a particular girdle once, though other girdles of this type can cause another transformation.]]></target>

The tail does not grant the wearer any additional attacks or actions per round, nor can it wield weapons, but it can make unarmed attacks and hold or manipulate objects about as well as the wearer's normal limbs (though any activity requiring fingers is beyond the tail's capabilities). The belt can function as a tail for 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive.]]></target>

Unfortunately, his attempt to create an eighth Alara'hai failed. Despite his skill and power, Xin simply couldn't equal even the least of the other Swords of Sin, a truth that vexed and humiliated him. The weapon he created, the ghost iron scimitar, was a significant weapon, but it was hardly an artifact. It wasn't even intelligent. Ashamed of the weapon, but secretly harboring the hope that someday he'd figure out how to improve it, Xin secreted the sword away in a Skymetal Vault and forgot about it. The ghost iron scimitar is a +2 dancing keen ghost touch inubrix scimitar. The weapon has been magically enhanced so that it still deals normal weapon damage for its size and is not treated as being broken, despite being made from a soft skymetal. It ignores armor and shield bonuses granted by metal objects. Although the weapon cannot damage metal creatures (and is thus not very effective against the clockwork reliquary), it can be presented to the clockwork reliquary as an example of one of Xin's failures to aid in triggering its unstable mind.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The sacred weapon known as Dawnflower's Kiss is said to have been one of a dozen identical weapons created long ago when Sarenrae split open the world while fighting Rovagug. When she did this, fragments of the world turned molten by her blade flew from the battle, landing in remote parts of Golarion where they cooled and transformed into these potent scimitars. The weapons were sought out by her church and were entrusted to her greatest champions. Over time, though, those champions fell and the blades were lost. A Dawnflower's Kiss is a +4 holy flaming scimitar. Once per round as a standard action, the wielder can slash at the air with a Dawnflower's Kiss to fire a single bolt of searing light from the weapon. Once per day, the wielder may instead unleash a sunbeam with this standard action. In the hands of a worshiper of Sarenrae, the scimitar becomes a +5 holy flaming burst scimitar that functions as a divine focus for spellcasting. If used as a divine focus, the scimitar increases the save DC for the spell cast by 1. Finally, by expending one use of mythic power, a worshiper of Sarenrae can as a standard action throw the sword to make a single attack against up to eight targets within 60 feet of her-these attacks resolve as melee attacks made at the worshiper's highest attack bonus. The Dawnflower's Kiss found in this adventure was claimed long ago by Baphomet from a paladin of Sarenrae after her husband betrayed her to the Horned Lord. The blade has been corrupted-it now functions as a +4 unholy flaming scimitar, and none of its other powers function at all until it is cleansed, such as through the redeemed corruption forge back in Drezen or a miracle spell, or by bringing the scimitar to the unquiet shade of Lady Cessily Mantiel in area H2. When handed the weapon, she sighs in relief and infuses the blade with her spirit, restoring it to full functionality while simultaneously releasing her spirit from the prison.]]></target>

The demon lord emerged fully formed, and the crafting of this weapon was among the first of his acts-Riftcarver aided the demon lord tremendously in those first few thousand centuries of his life, and was the primary tool he used to dig the Rasping Rifts. Riftcarver is a Gargantuan +5 defending unholy wounding scythe. As part of its first successful hit against a target in any one round, Riftcarver can infest the creature hit with rot grubs (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 245). Once per minute as a standard action by striking at the ground, Riftcarver can create an earthquake centered on the target's location. Riftcarver's wielder never suffers any ill effects from earthquakes created by the scythe. Once per day, the scythe can be swept through the air as a standard action to rip a hole between worlds that serves as a 20-foot-diameter gate-this gate can be used only for planar travel, not for calling creatures. Riftcarver is made of the chitin of an Abyssal monster, yet it is treated as adamantine for the purposes of damaging objects and penetrating hardness. Smaller versions of this artifact, built to be used by Medium cultists, also exist. Called rotcarvers, the majority of these weapons have been captured and destroyed by the crusaders by the Fifth Crusade. A rotcarver is a +3 scythe that can infest those it strikes with rot grubs, or can transform its user into a rot grub swarm. Rotcarvers are detailed on page 51 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Abat-Ne, better known as the Blackstone Mace, is a +2 defiant light mace named for the fist-sized mystic ebon s tone that serves as the weapon's head. This stone head is set on a plain wooden handle fitted with a bronze hand guard, though closer inspection reveals that the hand guard was likely added some years after the weapon was made. Constructed for those whose task was driving back and crushing foreigners seeking to usurp the kingdom of Osirion from its true people, the Blackstone Mace senses anyone within 60 feet who was not born in Osirion, and immediately alerts its owner of all such threats. Unfortunately, the mace is unable to distinguish between foreigners who pose legitimate threats and those with good intentions. Instead, whenever the mace detects someone non-native, it immediately presses its owner to drive that person off-or, if the encounter seems especially dangerous, to kill her. To get the mace to cease its demands, the wielder must succeed at a Will save against the mace's Ego. If the wielder fails this struggle for dominance, his only recourse is to try to convince the mace of the foreigner's innocent intentions. Similarly, the mace fails to identify native Osirians who may pose a threat. If used against a native Osirian, the mace refuses to aid its wielder and shuts down its offensive magical properties, instead functioning as a nonmagical masterwork light mace. In order to restore its powers, the wielder must reason with the weapon and convince it that the individual or individuals that were attacked pose a serious threat to Osirion. Not only is the mace prejudiced, it is also arrogant and has the unfortunate quirk of constantly retelling the same stories about how it helped various warriors throughout the centuries achieve their victories. Still, once the mace commits to vanquishing an opponent, it proves relentless in fulfilling its purpose.]]></target>

Once he does, it instead causes one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the nearest creature each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating from the battle by the safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the summon monster spell and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until killed, act as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with a permanent duration. Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried or underwater), they instead appear at the nearest safe location within 50 feet. Successful curse-breaking magic cast on the shield restores it to its previous guise as an absorbing shield and allows its wearer to abandon it.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The Shield of Aroden is a +5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield. Once per day, the bearer can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage similarly to the spell flame strike. Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, the bearer can use the shield to redirect the attack to himself, taking all effects from that attack as if he were the intended target. All allies within 100 feet of the bearer gain the effect of bless and prayer. Additionally, all allies within 100 feet of the bearer know his relative position and condition, as per the spell status. Beyond these properties, the Shield of Aroden is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack that would kill the bearer (not merely make him unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the shield and leaving the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures). For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield would turn to stone and shatter instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save against horrid wilting, the shield would turn to dry splinters. This power always destroys the shield, reducing it to 1d20 nearly invulnerable shards that suggest the way in which it was last destroyed. The Shield of Aroden bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature possesses the shield.]]></target>

Once he does, it instead causes one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the nearest creature each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating by the safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the summon monster spell and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until killed, act as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with a permanent duration. Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried or underwater), they instead appear at the nearest safe location within 50 feet. Successful curse-breaking magic cast on the shield restores it to its previous guise as an absorbing shield and allows its wearer to abandon it.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This +4 determinationUE heavy steel shield has the preserved head of a medusa mounted in its center, its eyes shut tight. It grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws and immunity to gaze attacks. When the wearer fights defensively or uses Combat Expertise, the shield's bonuses to AC and on saving throws increase to +6. When she's taking the total defense action, the bonuses increase to +10. As a standard action, the wearer of the aegis can expend one use of mythic power to awaken the medusa's head, causing its serpentine hair to writhe and its glowing, red eyes to open. This unleashes a cone of widened fear in the direction of the wearer's choice. The head remains awakened for 1 round per tier the wearer possesses, during which the wearer gains a petrifying gaze like that of the medusa's (turn to stone permanently, 30 feet), except the effect is caused by meeting the gaze of the shield's mounted head rather than the bearer's gaze. The save DC for both the fear and petrification effects is equal to 10 + the wearer's tier + the wearer's Charisma modifier. While the medusa's head is awakened, the wearer can attempt to make an enemy look into its eyes as a standard action, using the normal rules for gaze attacks (Bestiary 300).]]></target>

Whenever the bearer of this shield successfully deflects a projectile using the shield, she can, as a free action, expend one use of mythic power to redirect the deflected projectile toward any creature to which she has a clear line of effect, using the original attacker's attack and damage rolls. The range increment penalty on the attack roll of this deflected projectile is calculated from the original point at which the projectile was fired. For example, a foe fires an arrow from his shortbow (range increment 60 feet) at a mythic character bearing a shieldmarshal's ward who is 100 feet away, taking a -2 penalty on his attack roll. The mythic character deflects the arrow toward the same foe, meaning the arrow has traveled a total of 200 feet, which imposes a -6 penalty on the attack roll to hit the foe (since three range increments of 60 feet equals 180 feet). A character who possesses levels in the shieldmarshal prestige class (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige 48) can bear a shieldmarshal's ward without penalty, even if she isn't proficient with it.]]></target>

Three times per day as a swift action, the bearer of this +1 arrow deflection heavy wooden shield can select a single square within 5 feet (including the square occupied by the bearer) and extend a barrier of protective force around the square that lasts for 1d4 rounds. The barrier appears as a shimmer in the air, but it does not impede vision, movement, or other actions.

Scarab shields are especially favored by archaeologists and tomb raiders for the protection they grant against guardians and vermin frequently found in ancient ruins and forgotten tombs. Once per day on command, a scarab shield grants its wielder a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects for 3 minutes. At any time while this bonus is in effect, the wielder can end the effect as a swift action for a burst of healing energy. The wielder loses the saving throw bonus, but is healed of 1d8+3 points of damage. In addition, a scarab shield can protect its wielder from swarms. If a mindless swarm attempts to enter the wielder's space, the swarm must attempt a DC 11 Will save. If the save succeeds, the swarm can enter the wielder's space and attack the wielder normally. If the save fails, the swarm instinctively avoids the space occupied by the wielder, completely ignoring the wielder for 3 rounds. This effect ends if the wielder makes any attacks, but the wielder may use non-attack spells or otherwise act without ending the effect. This ability functions once per day.]]></target>

There are seven such holes in total on the front of shield, each varying in size, with an equal number of thin hemp strings on the reverse side. As a standard action, the wielder of the broadside bulwark can pull one of the strings, causing a small red bead to fly out from the associated gun port. This bead travels 30 feet forward and detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half), leaving the wielder outside the blast radius unless it contacts something before reaching 30 feet. After a string is pulled, its associated gun port is permanently closes and can no longer be used. The gun ports are different sizes, and include three small ports that deal 3d6 points of fire damage, three larger ports that deal 6d6 points of fire damage, and one massive port in the center of the shield that deals 9d6 points of fire damage.

However, after wearing it for 7 days, its owner instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher). Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he is in a situation in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to avoiding the increased hunger and thirst-on any day he eats at least one meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage from failing these checks. Once its curse activates, the ring cannot be removed until the curse is broken.]]></target>

After Aroden's death, the rings were cast aside or lost. Recently, several resurfaced, but changed by unknown means- Gaspodar's face now bears a sorrowful expression, and flames loom behind him. As a standard action, you may charge the ring with a +1 profane bonus by sacrificing 2 of your hit points. These hit points remain lost and cannot be healed by any means until the ring's power is expended. You may do this multiple times, up to a maximum of a +5 profane bonus stored in the ring. As an immediate action, you can add the stored profane bonus to any single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw, which expends the charged energy from the ring. You must declare this use after rolling the die but before you learn the result of the roll. You must expend all the ring's power at once. Once the charge is expended, you can heal your lost hit points normally. Expending this charge does not ruin the ring, and you may charge it again by sacrificing more hit points. The charge in the ring can come from multiple donors, but none of the donors can regain their sacrificed hit points until the ring's charge is spent or the ring is destroyed. For this reason, owners of a ring of terrible cost guard the item carefully.]]></target>

Spells that usually only affect one specific action (such as making a particular attack) are expended after that action. This does not reduce the duration of spells that normally last longer than 24 hours. Casting a new spell does not eliminate a previous spell if its normal duration is such that it would still be in effect.

This activation causes one of the ring's nine garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed. The price of the ring is reduced by 5,000 gp for each of its garnets that has been destroyed.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[All four kinds of rings of elemental command are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties. Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made. Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her. The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows. ELEMENT SAVING THROW PENALTY Air -2 against earth-based effects Earth -2 against air- or electricity-based effects Fire -2 against water- or cold-based effects Water -2 against fire-based effects In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind. RING OF ELEMENTAL COMMAND (AIR) • Wind wall (unlimited use) • Feather fall (unlimited use, wearer only) • Resist energy (electricity) (unlimited use, wearer only) • Gust of wind (twice per day) • Air walk (once per day, wearer only) • Chain lightning (once per week) This ring appears to be a ring of feather falling until a certain condition is met to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it. RING OF ELEMENTAL COMMAND (EARTH) • Soften earth and stone (unlimited use) • Meld into stone (unlimited use, wearer only) • Stone shape (twice per day) • Wall of stone (once per day) • Stoneskin (once per week, wearer only) • Passwall (twice per week) This ring appears to be a ring of meld into stone (allowing the wearer to cast meld into stone at will) until the established condition is met. RING OF ELEMENTAL COMMAND (FIRE) • Resist energy (fire) (as a major ring of energy resistance [fire]) • Burning hands (unlimited use) • Flaming sphere (twice per day) • Pyrotechnics (twice per day) • Wall of fire (once per day) • Flame strike (twice per week) This ring appears to be a major ring of energy resistance (fire) until the established condition is met. RING OF ELEMENTAL COMMAND (WATER) • Create water (unlimited use) • Water breathing (unlimited use) • Water walk (unlimited use) • Wall of ice (once per day) • Ice storm (twice per week) • Control water (twice per week) This ring appears to be a ring of water walking until the established condition is met.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This ring has two modes of operation: one for when the wearer is in dim light or outdoors at night, and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night. At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command. • Dancing lights (once per hour) • Light (twice per night) • Ball lightning (special, once per night) • Shooting stars (special, three per week) The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. NUMBER OF BALLS DAMAGE PER BALL 1 lightning ball 2d6 points of electricity damage 2 lightning balls 3d6 points of electricity damage 3 lightning balls 2d6 points of electricity damage 4 lightning balls 1d6 points of electricity damage Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round. The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. • Faerie fire (once per day) • Spark shower (special, once per day) The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arch 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage.]]></target>

The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring wearer. The ram is Large and uses the ring's caster level as its base attack bonus, with a Strength of 25. This gives the ram a Combat Maneuver Bonus of +17. The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended. In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with a Strength score of 25. This usage expends 1 charge. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with a Strength score of 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength score of 29. A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.]]></target>

It takes 10 minutes to use this ability. • The wearer can use spectral hand, as the spell, three times per day. • The wearer's weapons gain the ghost touch weapon special ability while the wearer is wielding the weapons. • The wearer gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws against positive and negative energy effects. The bonus depends on the wearer's alignment-good-aligned wearers gain a sacred bonus, whereas evil-aligned wearers gain a profane bonus. Neutral-aligned wearers pick either a sacred or profane bonus when the ring is first put on, which cannot be changed later .]]></target>

The disease causes 1d4 points of ability damage, with the affected ability being the wearer's highest ability score (or her choice in the case of equally high scores). The disease's other effects are detailed below. The saving throw to resist the disease is equal to 10 + the wearer's Hit Dice + her Charisma modifier. This disease can be cured as normal.

                    <target><![CDATA[The gem set within this remarkably ancient ring is distinctly cut to exhibit nine perfect facets, each of a different hue. Each day at sunrise, the gem rotates to display a different facet. The active facet determines the ring's power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 on the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table to determine which facet-and thus which power-is active. The wearer of the ring can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one she does not desire. The gem can only be turned in a particular order that shifts the active facet to the next highest facet, and each facet is a particular number of steps away from one another (see the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table). To change the facet, the wearer must succeed at a Wisdom check as a full-round action, and the wearer takes nonlethal damage, regardless of success. The DC of the Wisdom check to turn the gem is 15 + 5 per 1-step increase, while the nonlethal damage dealt equals 1d6 per 1-step increase. For example, if the facet of the day were yellow, the wearer could attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check and take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to copper, or attempt a DC 25 Wisdom check and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to green. The ring's facets cannot be shifted backwards (thus, yellow cannot turn directly to white; it must shift through all seven other colors to reach white). The ring's facet can only be changed once per day. Any nongood creature that wears the Ring of Nine Facets immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and another 2d6 points of nonlethal damage every minute it continues to wear the ring. 1d10/Step Facet Color Active Facet Power 1 Green Wearer is immune to disease 2 Indigo Wearer needs no air to survive 3 Orange Wearer gains a +5 natural armor bonus 4 Violet Wearer gains low-light vision 5 Red Wearer gains fast healing 1 6 Blue Wearer can use fly at will 7 White Wearer gains cold resistance 30 8 Yellow Wearer gains freedom of movement 9 Copper Wearer gains a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws 10* Roll again. * This step does not count as a facet for the purposes of adjusting the ring's daily ability.]]></target>

However, after wearing it for 7 days, its owner instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher). Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he is in a situation in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to avoiding the increased hunger and thirst-on any day he eats at least one meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage from failing these checks. Once its curse activates, the ring cannot be removed until the curse is broken.]]></target>

Baba Yaga crafted the Artrosa Ring for her chosen warden of the sacred site of Artrosa, and it functions as a ring of protection +2 and a ring of regeneration. Within 15 miles of Artrosa's towering figures, the Artrosa Ring also grants its wearer the following abilities. Quicksilver: The wearer can teleport to any location inside Artrosa's dungeons or within a 15-mile radius of Artrosa. Any location in this area is considered "very familiar." Seer: By concentrating for 10 minutes, the wearer can see and hear everything that transpires in a single chamber inside Artrosa, as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance. Shroud: Three times per day, the wearer can alter the appearance of a single room within one of Artrosa's dungeons, as well as the appearance of any creatures inside the room, as with mirage arcana and veil. The wearer must be present in the room to use this ability, and the illusions fade as soon as the wearer leaves the room. Threefold Aspect: Whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons, her age and appearance shift to match that of the corresponding dungeon (maiden, mother, or crone) as if affected by the threefold aspectAPG spell. If the wearer moves to a different dungeon, her age and appearance change accordingly. The wearer doesn't gain additional skill ranks, and a spellcaster doesn't gain any additional bonus spells for her increased ability scores, but the save DCs for her spells do increase. Outside these dungeons, the wearer returns to her natural age and appearance. The wearer has no control over this ability-it automatically takes effect whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons. Vision: If the wearer is a witch of at least 10th level, she gains access to the vision major hex and can use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. Outside of Artrosa, the Artrosa Ring loses all of the above abilities except its function as a ring of protection +2 and a ring of regeneration. In addition, the wearer can use the ring to cast threefold aspectAPG once per day.]]></target>

While enhancing a spell this way, the caster can expend one use of mythic power plus an additional use per two spell levels (minimum two uses), to instead cast the mythic version of her spell (though not an augmented version of the mythic spell) as if she knew the mythic version of that spell. This has no effect if the spell doesn't have a mythic version. The save DC increase for being a potent mythic spell (see page 80) stacks with the save DC increase granted by using the ring's power. For example, if the wearer enhances fireball with this ring, she can expend two uses of mythic power to cast mythic fireball instead (one use plus one use for a 3rd-level spell).]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A ring of equilibrium is a wooden ring carefully carved from core of an oak tree, decorated with delicate runes, and sanded and finished to be perfectly round, smooth, and symmetrical. When slipped on a finger, it sizes itself appropriately. It's said the ring has a will of its own, but if it does, it evinces no obvious agenda. It favors wearers who possess strong personality traits-either those with strong morals, who exemplify goodness and honor, or those utterly devoid of morals, with the vilest and blackest souls imaginable. The ring especially favors mythic creatures, and often refuses to slip onto the finger of a creature that lacks strong personality traits or isn't mythic. The ring has no special power over the living, but when its wearer dies or it's placed on the finger of a dead creature it deems worthy, the corpse and equipment of the wearer remain where they are but the ring vanishes entirely. Within 24 hours, a tree grows in a location that's as close as possible to where the wearer died. The next day, the tree splits along the middle, revealing a cavity where the wearer has been resurrected whole and uninjured, with the ring still adorning her finger. If the wearer died in an unsafe place, the tree appears as close to that location as possible while still being relatively safe for the wearer. This rebirth comes at a price. The wearer receives certain knowledge that somewhere in the world, another being has been resurrected along with her-an individual of an opposite alignment who is every bit as wretched as the wearer is good, or vice versa. The opposite has roughly the same level and power as the wearer. The wearer has no knowledge of this other party whatsoever, other than that it exists and is free to do whatever it wishes-perpetrate any crime or perform any good deed- thanks to the wearer. This opposite is always brought back a considerable distance from the wearer. If the wearer dies again but the opposite doesn't, the wearer is resurrected again, along with another creature of an opposed nature. This cycle continues indefinitely until the ring is discarded or it moves on.]]></target>

After 4 more days of attunement, the wearer gains the ability to read the language as well, though not the ability to write that language, and gains a +5 competence bonus on opposed Sense Motive checks against speakers of the attuned language. These benefits expire once the wearer has been out of contact with people who speak the attuned language for longer than 1 day or when the ring becomes attuned to a new language.]]></target>

If the wearer has the grit class feature, she can expend grit (maximum 4 grit points) to imbue bullets merged with the gun with one or more of these abilities. Imbuing a bullet with a +1 special ability costs 1 grit point; imbuing one with a +2 special ability costs 2 grit points. Each ring's special abilities are established upon the item's creation and can't be changed.

Clerics of Sarenrae prize glorious flame rings as facets through which they may channel their deity's divine will. Once per day, the wearer may speak the ring's command word to create a 5-foot-radius burst of flame centered on herself. This burst of flame deals 1d6 points of damage to any adjacent creatures (Reflex DC 14 halves), though the wearer is safe from this effect. If the wearer is capable of channeling positive energy, she may as a standard action expend one use of channeled energy to activate the ring's burst of flame, even if she has already spoken the ring's command word for the day. If the wearer also has the Selective Channeling feat, she may select a number of allies equal to her Charisma modifier to exclude from the burst of flame; these allies are not affected by the flame. This effect is otherwise identical to creating the ring's burst of flame by speaking the command word.]]></target>

The pelt functions as furs, granting its wearer a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist cold weather. The wearer can, as a standard action, transform into a Large winter wolf as if using beast shape IV. In certain special locations where winter wolves have the ability to take human form, such as the Howlings district of Whitethrone or the town of Redtooth, the wearer of a rimepelt in wolf form can take human form as winter wolves do, appearing as a white-haired, blue-eyed human. In either wolf or human form, the wearer of a rimepelt smells like a winter wolf to other winter wolves and creatures with the scent ability. When the wearer returns to his normal form, or after 2 hours have elapsed, the rimepelt becomes a mundane winter wolf pelt. Very rarely, a properly skinned winter wolf pelt manifests the properties of a rimepelt without requiring additional enchantment. A winter wolf whose pelt has such potential usually manifests some telltale physical attribute, such as heterochromatic eyes. Creating a rimepelt from such a rare creature requires a successful DC 25 Profession (hunter) or Survival check. Taking 20 is not allowed in this situation, and a failed check results in the pelt being utterly ruined for any use.]]></target>

At the start of each day, the owner of a mantle of the protector may spend 10 minutes attuning the mantle to his armor and shield. He may then lend his attuned mantle to an ally, who can activate it as an immediate action at any time to gain the owner's armor and shield bonus as well as any other special properties the armor may have for 10 minutes. When the mantle is activated this way, the owner's armor and shield go dormant, and he loses any benefits they may provide for 1 minute.]]></target>

The cloak can be used for a maximum of 10 rounds per day, which don't have to be consecutive. By expending one use of mythic power, the cloak's wearer can recharge its immolation abilities. In addition, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to detonate in a fiery explosion, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage per character level in a 30-foot-radius spread. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + the wearer's mythic tier + the wearer's Charisma modifier) halves this damage. Though apparently destroyed in the explosion, the wearer reforms just prior to the start of his next turn in the space he exploded in (or the nearest open space if that space is unavailable).]]></target>

The wearer can use this ability for up to 10 rounds per day, which don't need to be consecutive. If the wearer takes damage that would reduce her below 0 hit points, she can expend one use of mythic power to transform into a phoenix-like being. This doesn't require an action. When this happens, she is immediately affected as though targeted with a breath of life spell (CL 9th) and polymorphs into a bird-like creature made of flames (as elemental body II, CL 9; fire elemental only).

                    <target><![CDATA[These lustrous animal pelts are particularly treasured among Ulfen barbarians. While any humanoid creature can don and use such pelts, their powers are vastly enhanced for skinwalkers. All pelts of the beast grant the following powers: •A bite attack that deals damage appropriate to the wearer's size. If the wearer already has a bite attack, the critical threat range of this attack doubles. This does not stack with other magical effects that increase the threat range of a natural weapon. • Speak with animals 1/day. If the wearer can already use speak with animals as a spell-like ability, she may do so at will. • The wearer may take the form of the animal from which the pelt came three times per day as if using beast shape I. In addition, if the wearer is a skinwalker, her change shape ability is enhanced so that she may gain an additional bestial feature when taking her bestial form, selectable from the skinwalker heritage tied to the animal from which the pelt came. For instance, a werewolf-kin wearing a bear pelt of the beast could use her change shape ability to gain a climb speed from the pelt's bestial features (identical to the set listed for werebear-kin) in addition to darkvision from her set of werewolf-kin bestial features. Feats or abilities that affect how many bestial features the skinwalker may gain at a single time stack with this ability. Each pelt also grants a competence bonus on a check, based on its type. These bonuses increase by 50% for skinwalkers wearing a pelt that matches their lycanthropic heritage. • Bat: +4 bonus on Perception checks in darkness • Bear: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple • Boar: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to bull rush • Crocodile: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder • Rat: +2 bonus on saving throws against disease • Shark: +2 bonus on Perception and Swim checks attempted while completely underwater • Tiger: +2 bonus on Stealth checks • Wolf: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to trip Other pelts of the beast may be available at the GM's discretion.]]></target>

The shimmering fabric of this light silver-and-red cloak never dirties or wrinkles, and when laid out flat, the cloak reflects light nearly as well as a mirror. A fully charged cloak of moral refraction has 3 charges-charges used are automatically renewed at a rate of 1 charge per day at dawn. The wearer may use the cloak to expend these charges and create the following effects. • 1 charge: Dispel an ongoing spell with an alignment descriptor, as the third function of dispel chaos/evil/good/law. • 2 charges: Ready an action to counter a spell or spell-like ability with an alignment descriptor. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. The charges are expended only after countering a spell or spell-like ability. If you ready this action but it is not triggered, the charges are not expended. • 3 charges: As an immediate action, counter a spell or spell-like ability cast by an outsider with an alignment subtype. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. In addition, the outsider must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be banished back to its home plane, as banishment. An outsider with more than 26 Hit Dice is unaffected by the banishment effect.]]></target>

Each time a creature of the wearer's size or smaller attempts to grapple the wearer, it must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fail at the attempt and be engulfed by quicksand (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427). Every round it's trapped in the extradimensional space, the trapped creature must make a Swim check (DC 15) to climb out, landing prone adjacent to the wearer. Crawling out doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from the wearer, but does provoke from others. A creature that fails its Swim check by 5 or more submerges and begins to drown. A creature that succeeds at the initial save grapples the wearer normally, and doesn't need to save again unless the wearer escapes and the creature tries to grapple the wearer again. A quicksand cloak left on the ground behaves as a patch of quicksand filling one 5-foot square, and swimming out works the same. Others may use aid another to help a creature trapped in the cloak, as though the creature were grappled. A quicksand cloak of any size can contain only one creature at a time; a creature attempting to grapple the wearer while the cloak already contains a body is not affected by the cloak.]]></target>

On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment-good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required. Only a wish or a miracle can restore a character's former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a helm of opposite alignment has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.]]></target>

The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell shout, though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect. The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times per day the clasp of the mind scream can be used. If the wearer attempts to use the clasp beyond this number of times, he is affected by its effects and the clasp is inert for the next 24 hours.]]></target>

The helm allows the wearer to see in every direction, granting him immunity to being flanked, as well as granting a +4 enhancement bonus on all vision-based Perception checks. One in every 10 Vudran Ashak helmets is an intelligent magical item, having spontaneously manifested such properties after the deaths of heroically devoted former wearers. Such helms are lawful good, speak Vudran, and have an ego score of 10. These lingering personalities prove noble, knowledgable of Vudra's diverse deities, and actively encourage wearers to defend the holy places of such gods and their devout worshipers. Some might even possess goals from their lives that they wish their new wearer to fulfill. Despite any of the helmet's desires, though, it possesses no way to compel a wearer other than deactivating or reactivating its magical properties at will.]]></target>

Once he does, the hat causes him to assume the guise of the creature or person the hostile creature most wants to harm. The hat never causes the wearer to assume the appearance of someone the viewer wouldn't harm if he had the opportunity (for example, the greatly feared leader of the local temple). Once the hat reveals its true abilities, it no longer responds to attempts by its wearer to change his appearance. Instead, it automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to and despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary illusions that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or weak. For example, in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like the tribe's chief, but sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town, the wearer may look like the hated local bully, drunk and staggering. In an evil town, the wearer looks like a confused visitor and appears to be an ideal target to victimize with some crime. Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.]]></target>

Within the Society, legends hold that many of these masks are actually powerful magical items called Decemvirate helms, said to have been discovered by Durvin Gest on his first expedition to the ruined continent of Azlant. According to these stories, the helms not only mask the wearers' faces, but also function as helms of telepathy combined with amulets of proof against detection and location. The wearer of a Decemvirate helm can use disguise self at will and benefits from discern lies and true seeing at all times. The helm provides 100% protection from all gaze attacks and all forms of magical control. Specific Decemvirate helms may have additional powers as well- certainly, all are said to be unique in physical appearance. Of course, beyond these few details that most Pathfinders hold as fact, little is known about the helms, and they remain some of the Pathfinder Society's greatest and most secret treasures-if one were to fall into the possession of anyone other than a Decemvirate member, the Society would undoubtedly spare no expense in retrieving the item. Some stories tell of non-Decemvirate Pathfinders being temporarily granted the use of the items or "borrowing" them, but such reports are likely little more than groundless boasts.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: • Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20) • Ruby: Wall of fire • Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half) • Opal: Daylight The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated. It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.]]></target>

It still glows near and harms undead, has the flaming weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).

                    <target><![CDATA[This headband is decorated with feathers from a number of colorful birds. It grants boons to flying magic, and more powerful versions grant the power of flight. The wearer of a headband of aerial agility +2 treats his caster level as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating extracts that grant flight. A headband of aerial agility +4 gains the same benefits and, on command, grants the wearer the ability to fly (as the fly spell) three times per day. A headband of aerial agility +6 functions like a +4 version, but the headband grants the ability to use fly at will. All versions also grant the wearer an enhancement bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. This bonus is chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence, usually granting ranks in Fly, Acrobatics, or Knowledge (planes).]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This band of reddish fox fur is marked on the front with a distinctive symbol that constantly shifts into a different character. The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. This bonus is chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence. If the wearer is a creature who uses magic to change form, she gains the following additional benefits. Shifter's headband +2: The wearer treats her caster level as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating extracts of the polymorph subschool. Shifter's headband +4: Once per day while under the effect of a polymorph spell or extract, the wearer can assume another form allowed by that effect. This is a standard action. Shifter's headband +6: Whenever the wearer changes her shape with a polymorph effect, she gains DR 5/silver for 1 minute (this ends if she returns to her natural form). These additional shapeshifter abilities are cumulative. For example, a creature wearing a shifter's headband +4 gains the extra transformation ability and treats her caster level as 1 higher than normal for polymorph spells and extracts.]]></target>

A soulbound eye is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear- they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A soulbound eye must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow-the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the "master"). Once implanted, the soulbound eye allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries. The soulbound eye's wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory, pain strike (Advanced Player's Guide), and suggestion spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the soulbound eye. An implanted soulbound eye functions like a cursed item once it is in place-it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like remove curse or break enchantment. Once removed, a soulbound eye crumbles to fragments.]]></target>

When worn, the veiled eye has the same vision as the wearer (such as low-light vision, darkvision 60 ft., or the oracle's clouded vision curse). It grants the wearer no particular advantages so long as his original eyes continue to function normally. However, should his original eyes stop working, whether because of the wearer becoming blinded or even his own decision to close them, he can see through the veiled eye instead. When the wearer is using the veiled eye as his only vision source, he takes a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls but gains a +2 insight bonus on saves against gaze attacks.]]></target>

Taking off the crown also takes a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and can be taken only by the creature who put the crown on the wearer, or at the command of that creature. Although the crown's spikes dig into the head of the wearer, it does no permanent harm aside from leaving four vicious-looking scars once the crown is removed. Once a creature becomes a thrall of the crown's user, it must do everything the user commands, as per the spell dominate person-though the crown's dominance is not limited to humanoids, lasts as long the creature is wearing the crown, and allows no saving throw.]]></target>

In the hands of a paladin, the Thorncrown reveals its true powers, bursting into flames and spinning above the wearer's head in a halo of divine power. Paladins of any faith who wear the Thorncrown have their class abilities enhanced for as long as they wear it, gaining three additional mercies (from levels they have access to but have not selected), healing the maximum amount possible every time they use lay on hands, and gaining a number of additional uses of smite evil equal to their Charisma modifier. Additionally, if a paladin wearing the Thorncrown is slain, she may choose to instantly be restored to full hit points for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier. She may act as normal for this period, but at the end of this time she dies and cannot be restored by any means short of a miracle cast by a cleric of her faith. The Thorncrown of Iomedae bestows two negative levels on any evil creature that wears it. These negative levels remain as long as the Thorncrown is held or worn-though they never result in actual level loss, they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature possesses the Thorncrown. Additionally, paladins who either break their code of conduct while wearing the Thorncrown or do not have access to their class features when they don the artifact must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or instantly be disintegrated. Those slain by the Thorncrown cannot be brought back to life by clerics with good or lawful components to their alignment-their spells simply fail-though clerics of other alignments can restore a paladin as normal. Even those who succeed at this save are treated as though they were evil creatures and gain negative levels. Paladins who receive atonement can wear the Thorncrown again without fear of ill effects.]]></target>

The crown only works for a single creature for whom the crown was specifically crafted. A simurgh can create one crown of the simurgh every 500 years. While wearing a crown of the simurgh, the wearer is constantly affected by the spell protection from evil. Once per day, the wearer of this crown can spend a full-round action concentrating to mentally contact the simurgh who created the crown. If the simurgh allows this connection to be made, the wearer instantly knows the distance and direction of the simurgh and can communicate with it as per the spell sending. Should the simurgh be on the same plane and both parties wish it, the crown's wearer can teleport to the simurgh's location. Ten minutes after teleporting to the simurgh's side, however, the crown's wearer teleports back to wherever he was before teleporting (or the nearest safe square), whether he wishes to or not. As a final effort or in a time of great need, the wearer can take a full-round action to hold the crown to the sun and call out to the simurgh that created it. This summons the simurgh as per the spell summon monster IX. The simurgh remains for 1 minute, and follows the wearer's commands. At the end of this time, the simurgh vanishes and the crown is destroyed.]]></target>

The hat never causes the wearer to assume the appearance of someone the viewer wouldn't harm if he had the opportunity (for example, the greatly feared leader of the local temple). Once the hat reveals its true abilities, it no longer responds to attempts by its wearer to change his appearance. Instead, it automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to and despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary illusions that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or weak. For example, in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like the tribe's chief, but sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town, the wearer may look like the hated local bully, drunk and staggering. In an evil town, the wearer looks like a confused visitor and appears to be an ideal target to victimize with some crime. Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.]]></target>

On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment-good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required. Only a wish or a miracle can restore a character's former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a helm of opposite alignment has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.]]></target>

However, the wearer can't speak, and therefore can't cast spells or use items that require verbal components or command words. Once per day, but only after wearing the mask for at least 1 hour, the wearer can summon 1d4+1 nightgaunts to do her bidding, as if by casting summon monster VI. These nightgaunts remain for 11 rounds. Alternatively, the wearer can summon a single nightgaunt that remains for 24 hours. She can communicate with and thus give orders to these nightgaunts via telepathy to a range of 100 feet.

If she succeeds at a saving throw against a harmful mind-affecting effect, the surge of confidence gives her a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 minute. If she fails such a saving throw, she is instead shaken for 1 minute, though this condition doesn't stack with other fear effects to make her frightened or panicked. A mythic creature wearing the wreath gains 2 temporary hit points per tier at the start of each day. These temporary hit points are restored whenever the wearer rests 8 hours or otherwise gains the equivalent of doing so.]]></target>

When the wearer sleeps, she can create a pocket dream dimension and move herself there. The qualities of the dream dimension can be chosen by the wearer, as the create demiplaneUM spell. Once inside the dream dimension, the wearer is considered awake and in control of her creation. The pocket dimension lasts for up to 7 days, whereupon it ends and the diadem must recharge for 1 week before it can be used again, regardless of the time spent inside. There is one inherent risk in using the Diadem of Nod. The GM should roll a secret DC 20 Will save on behalf of the wearer each time the diadem is used. Failure indicates that some rogue element not of the wearer's creation or under her control has been added to the pocket dream dimension. This might be an animate dream (Bestiary 2 29) or some other outsider of any alignment that traffics the Ethereal and Astral planes. The rogue element is not necessarily hostile or unfriendly.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The Nimbus of Radiant Truth exists only when good has need of a great champion. Such a champion can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily as bright as continual flame, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance of daylight. Its radiance is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes of interaction with other sources of light and darkness. The radiance of the nimbus can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action. The Nimbus of Radiant Truth grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness, and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome damage reduction as though they were good-aligned. In addition, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth has the following powers. • The wearer can bring forth a zone of truth (DC 20) with a 40- foot radius at will. By expending one use of mythic power, the DC increases to 30. • As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of freedom's call (as the Liberation domain power) or nimbus of light (as the Sun domain power) for 2 minutes. For purposes of this power, the wearer has a cleric level equal to her character level. Either power can be dismissed as a free action, but any unused duration is lost. • Seven times per day, the wearer can cure moderate wounds as a cleric with a caster level equal to her character level. The wearer adds her mythic tier to the hit points healed. • Three times per day, the wearer can unleash a holy aura (DC 25) or an empowered holy smite (DC 22). • Once per day, the wearer can unleash a blast of righteous power. Treat this as sunburst (DC 27) centered on the wearer, except that it has no effect on good-aligned creatures and inflicts double damage to evil-aligned creatures. After this power is used, the nimbus fades to a barely visible glow for 1 hour, and the wearer loses access to all of its powers save its enhancement bonuses. She remains unable to lie. • Once per week, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to perform a resurrection. The wearer of the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can remove it as though it were a physical item, and place it either on the head of another creature or on an inanimate object. When placed on an inanimate object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can be picked up. When placed on a living creature, it can't be removed except by the wearer's conscious choice. When donned by a creature of evil alignment, the nimbus blasts the creature for 20d6 points of damage, then teleports 1d10x10 miles away in a random direction. However, if the wearer becomes evil some time after donning it, the nimbus retains its powers and doesn't damage the wearer. The nimbus cannot be deceived by any mortal means of masking alignment (including mythic abilities).]]></target>

The helmet was forged under duress by a dwarven smith to further the ambitions of his mad brother. The Tarnhelm has the following powers. • The wearer gains the shapechanger subtype. • The wearer gains immunity to polymorph effects, except ones he chooses to allow to affect him. • At will, the wearer can use greater invisibility as a spell-like ability for as long a duration as desired. • At will, the wearer can change his appearance in the same fashion as a hat of disguise, with a DC 25 Will save required to disbelieve the illusion. If the Tarnhelm is used to create a disguise, the wearer receives a +25 bonus on the Disguise check. • Three times per day, the wearer can use greater teleport, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name. The wearer can teleport additional times by expending one use of mythic power per teleport. • Three times per day, the wearer can assume the form of an animal as though he had cast beast shape IV, except the duration lasts until the effect is dismissed or dispelled. The wearer can change shape additional times by expending one use of mythic power per transformation. • By expending two uses of mythic power, the wearer can assume the form of Gargantuan chromatic or metallic dragon. The effect lasts until dispelled or dismissed. He gains a +14 size bonus to Strength, a +12 size bonus to Constitution, a +10 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 150 feet (poor), blindsense 90 feet, darkvision 180 feet, a breath weapon, DR 15/magic, frightful presence (DC 23), one bite (4d6), two claws (2d8), two wing attacks (2d6), and one tail slap (2d8). All his breath weapons deal 16d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save (DC 10 plus his tier plus his Constitution modifier) for half damage. This ability otherwise functions as form of the dragon III.]]></target>

In addition to that spell's usual effects, if the area has a powerful natural protector likely to be helpful to the wearer, this protector automatically learns of the wearer and her location as well as a vague impression of her needs. Once per day, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to cast charm monster on a creature (DC 16 negates); fey creatures targeted by this effect take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. Finally, as an immediate action the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to reroll any saving throw against a spell, spelllike ability, or supernatural ability of a fey, receiving a +2 bonus on the new saving throw. This ability must be used after the save but before the results are revealed. The wearer must take the result of the second roll, even if it's worse.]]></target>

Not even muffled cries for help can pierce the barrier created by a muzzle of suppression. The garment's keystone strap can only be opened by the creature that placed the muzzle on its subject; other creatures attempting to disassemble the strap must succeed at a DC 30 Disable Device check to do so.

                    <target><![CDATA[This crumpled leather hat has roughly hammered metal studs around its brim, and is often worn by worshipers of Droskar who venerate the dwarf god for his cheating aspect. The wearer can use it as a hat of disguise, but only to disguise herself as a dwarf. Three times per day as a free action, the wearer can manipulate a rolled die within 10 feet (such as in a game of chance), altering hands slot; the wearer can not use another item (even another Inheritor's gauntlet) that also uses the hands slot, though a matching nonmagical gauntlet is often worn on the other hand. If Iomedae is the wearer's patron, the gauntlet lets the wearer use any sword he holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word and give any sword he holds the powers of an evil outsider-bane weapon for 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the gauntlet. If the wearer uses a finger to draw Iomedae's symbol on any solid surface, the symbol glows as brightly as a candle for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first).]]></target>

Originally crafted for a wizard dedicated to Horus as a reward from his pharaoh for his prowess on the battlefield, the falcon crown was believed lost when the wizard was struck down by an ancient blue dragon. Centuries later, however, archaeologists discovered the falcon crown among the ruins of Tumen. Researcher-priests of Nethys acquired the crown shortly after, and when the Nethysian priestess Serethet became the Forgotten Pharaoh, she claimed the falcon crown for herself. The wearer of the falcon crown gains a +2 insight bonus to her Armor Class. In addition, up to three times per day as an immediate action, the wearer of the falcon crown can sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a damaging ray, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d4 points of damage for every level of the spell or spell slot sacrificed. A non-spellcaster cannot create rays with the falcon crown, but can still gain the AC bonus.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This pair of magnificent dark metal bracers is forged to depict the shape of a raven stretched over the wearer's forearm. Once prized by the last king of Zolurket, several additional raven bracers were created in the mines' final days to aid the king's bodyguards in defending him and maintaining communications throughout the mine. While worn, these bracers can be used as a swift action to grant the throwing and returning magic weapon qualities to any held melee weapon; these qualities persist for 1 round. This ability can be used three times a day. In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action, where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to silver raven figurines of wondrous power. Like those items, these ravens obey the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the animal messenger spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously for up to 24 hours. Once both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or once the 24-hour limit is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return unerringly to the owner's hands via teleportation. If the item's owner is no longer on the same plane as the bracers when this event occurs, they merely revert to bracer form and fall to the ground, awaiting a new owner to find and claim them for their own use.]]></target>

When he does so, a graven image of the weapon appears on the gauntlet's plates. The wearer can store up to 10 weapons in the gauntlets in this manner. Retrieving a weapon requires the wearer to touch the image of the weapon he wants. Doing so is a swift action. When a weapon is retrieved, it appears in the hands of the wearer and any weapons the wearer had in his hands is stored in the gauntlets. If there is no room in the gauntlet for the weapons the wearer is holding, those weapons are dropped. The gauntlets can only store weapons; other items cannot be placed in the gauntlet. Furthermore, three times per day on command, the gloves affect the wearer as the greater heroism spell.]]></target>

The wearer may treat these materials as having half as much hardness when attempting to damage or reshape them. For instance, a steel bar normally has 10 points of hardness, but the wearer of the gloves may treat it as having hardness 5, and shape it with woodworking tools.

Up to three times per day, the wearer way transform the gauntlet into an iron cobra (Bestiary 182), which crawls from the wearer's wrist and obeys his commands, leaving behind a simple bracelet of linked scales. Whoever wears the bracelet is the iron cobra's master. The iron cobra can remain animated for a total of 1 hour per day. If the snake is within hearing range of the master and commanded to revert to gauntlet form (a standard action), it travels to its master as fast as possible, crawls onto its master's arm, and as a free action reverts to its inactive shape. If the snake's duration expires before it can reach its master, it reverts to gauntlet form, but automatically melds with the bracelet if the two touch. If slain in cobra form, the snake reverts to gauntlet form and cannot be used again for 24 hours. If destroyed in gauntlet form, the item is destroyed. The wearer can refill the iron cobra's poison reservoir in snake form or gauntlet form.]]></target>

Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer of these gloves may attempt a disarm combat maneuver on a target within 30 feet. The target's item must be mostly made of metal. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the target is disarmed and the item falls to the ground in the target's square. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, the item lands 1 square closer to the wearer. If this would place the item in the wearer's square, the wearer may attempt to catch the item with a DC 10 Dexterity check; otherwise it lands in the wearer's square. The wearer can only use this ability if she has at least one hand free. If the wearer fails the combat maneuver check, she is not disarmed.]]></target>

The wearer can deliver the dose to a target as a melee touch attack or as part of an unarmed strike or natural attack with the hands (such as a claw or slam attack). The wearer can use both gloves in the same round using two-weapon fighting or multiple natural attacks (such as 2 slams or 2 claws). Each glove can be used once per day.

                    <target><![CDATA[Said to have first been forged centuries ago by a human master blacksmith who escaped from drow slavers in Sekamina, these shimmering silver gauntlets remind the wearer that she is always shackled to the deeds of her past, but remains unfettered with the promise of a freer future. The wearer of a pair of gauntlets of the unchained may only wield weapons two-handed-the magical chain that binds the gauntlets makes it effectively impossible to wield or hold more than one item at a time. By tapping the gauntlets' manacles together as a swift action, the wearer can cause damage dealt by her wielded weapon to become lawful-aligned and thus overcome the corresponding damage reduction. This effect lasts for up to 7 rounds per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-round increments. By breaking the magical chain that connects the gauntlets as a standard action, the wearer can cause her wielded weapon to gain the anarchic weapon special ability for 7 minutes. Once broken, the chain between the gauntlets is shattered forever, and the gauntlets become nonmagical.]]></target>

Thus picking a locked door wouldn't make a clicking noise audible to those on the other side, and holding a hand over a victim's mouth would silence his scream. The silence extends only a few inches, so knocking on a door produces no sound but hammering it down still does. If the wearer presses a finger to her lips and speaks, no sound comes out, but the words are audible to anyone she chooses in her line of sight (as the message spell).]]></target>

Whenever the wearer makes a melee touch attack, she deals 1d6 points of fire damage. If the wearer wields a weapon or makes an attack with an unarmed strike, that attack gains the flaming weapon special ability. When demonic smith's gloves are used during the construction of armor or weapons, they grant their wearer a +4 competence bonus on the relevant Craft checks. If the wearer rolls a natural 1 while benefiting from this bonus, she draws the ire of Flauros, causing the gloves to become nonmagical until the wearer crafts at least five masterwork items and then destroys them in the name of the demon lord.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This repugnant and cruel magic item consists of a chain of cold iron on which dangle six tiny, cold iron cages, each of which contains a living but miniaturized pixie. While the pixies are free to shriek and yell and cry, the item prevents them from taking any action that would directly free them from their cage and suppresses all of their supernatural and spell-like abilities. As a swift action, the wearer of a necklace of lovelies can redirect hit point damage inflicted on him from any single attack or effect that damages him onto one of the pixies on the necklace-doing so automatically kills the poor pixie in a tiny explosion of blood. Once all of the necklace's pixies are dead or released, the necklace becomes nonmagical. The magic of a necklace of lovelies can also be released by breaking open one of the tiny pixie cages (hardness 10; hp 10; Break DC 20). If the cage contains a living pixie, the grateful fey quickly escapes and returns to normal size-in so doing, the wash of energy allows the pixie to bestow luck upon the creature who broke that particular cage if the pixie so chooses (most pixies are grateful enough to a rescuer to automatically grant this boon). An instant after the luck is bestowed, the grateful pixie vanishes (presumably back to the area in which he or she was first imprisoned in the necklace during its creation). The luck granted by this effect can be used at any point once during the next 7 days as a swift action whenever a d20 is rolled-it allows the lucky soul to roll 2d20 and pick which result he wishes to accept.]]></target>

It contains a piece of the demon lord Kostchtchie's mortal soul, entrapped by the witch Baba Yaga. The torc grants its wearer immunity to cold and the ability to command frost giants at will. This ability functions as dominate person, but affects only frost giants, who take a -10 penalty on their saves. In addition, the wearer can cast giant form II three times per day. Anyone who wears the torc for 1 week also gains the ability to summon an aspect of Kostchtchie once per day. This aspect takes the form of an Abyss gigas (see Appendix 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour. Using the torc in this way certainly alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts, and the demon lord will not rest until he has recovered the torc. In addition, any time one of the torc's powers is used, there is a cumulative 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious or dead or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet.]]></target>

Created by the pactmasters of Katapesh to manipulate and control their constructs known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market. Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in Katapesh, punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects. If an aluum escapes this effect, it is no longer attuned and typically attacks the target who attempted to command it.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The shinobi fuhonsen is said to have been the first payment ever made to a ninja in the history of Minkai. The tarnished bronze coin has a square central hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces-four on one face and two on the other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck. The six ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen currently has six powers, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi fuhonsen gains an additional power based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges on the coin's surface. The new power and the skill it corresponds to are left up to the GM, though the power should be related to its skill, and the skill should be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing powers of the shinobi fuhonsen are based on skills common to rogues and bards, new powers and their corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new power may be unlocked per owner. The coin's powers only function for a worthy owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner. When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a new power, the new ideogram (and its associated power) appears on the coin on a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's powers until the next new moon, when he must make another save. The owner must make a new Will save at every new moon until his alignment becomes chaotic evil, or until the artifact is no longer in his possession. As long as the owner is not chaotic evil, he can simply discard the shinobi fuhonsen, at which point the coin vanishes at the next new moon. Once the owner becomes chaotic evil, the new ideogram (and its associated power) becomes permanent and he can no longer discard the coin, as if it were a cursed item. Each of the coin's powers can be activated by speaking the name of the corresponding ideogram, unless otherwise noted. The known powers (and their associated skills) of the shinobi fuhonsen are as follows. • Power #1 (Acrobatics): The owner can cast shadow walk once per day. • Power #2 (Climb): The owner can cast spider climb three times per day. • Power #3 (Disguise): The owner is permanently under the effects of misdirection. • Power #4 (Escape Artist): The owner can cast dimension door three times per day. • Power #5 (Perception): The owner can cast scrying once per day. • Power #6 (Stealth): The owner can cast mislead once per day. • Powers #7-8 (8 ranks in another skill): Yet to be discovered.]]></target>

As a standard action, the wearer of this brooch can transform his features to appear either entirely elven or entirely human. The magic of this brooch actually changes the wearer's features physically, granting him a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a member of the selected race. The transformation does not otherwise alter the wearer's features, and those who know him recognize him without a Perception check. This change remains until the brooch is used again or removed. This change does not radiate magic and cannot be seen with detect magic, although true seeing does reveal the alteration. This item only functions for half-elves, but there are versions that exist for half-orcs as well.]]></target>

When worn by an individual with the negative energy affinity racial trait, it alters the effects of positive energy on his body. When targeted by positive energy that heals living creatures, the wearer instead gains half the hit points the positive energy heals as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points go away after 10 minutes. This effect does not stack with life channel (see below) or other effects that convert healing positive energy to temporary hit points. This item does not actually transpose positive energy into negative energy, it just affects the way the wearer's body reacts to positive energy. Only a living creature can benefit from this amulet; it provides no benefit to undead.]]></target>

These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords; the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a scrying device (such as a runewell), a runelord can sense the world through the Sihedron medallion wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice-provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a Sihedron medallion in Xin-Shalast. While worn, a Sihedron medallion grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. Once per day, as a free action, it may be commanded to bestow the effects of false life on the wearer. Placed on the neck of a dead body, a Sihedron medallion preserves the body indefinitely via a gentle repose effect.]]></target>

Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the Eldritch Heritage feat in Ultimate Magic) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule's bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged). The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed. As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the sorcerer's bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline's bonus feat list.]]></target>

The target receives a DC 15 Reflex saving throw to avoid the chain. If the saving throw fails, the target is entangled and cannot move from its current location. As a full-round action, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; otherwise it persists for 10 minutes or until ended by the wearer as a swift action, at which point it returns to its carcanet form.

If worn by a creature of the animal type with an Intelligence less than 3, a collar of the true companion grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. This does not give the animal the ability to speak, but it does allow it to understand one spoken language (chosen by the item's creator). If the collar is worn for at least 1 week by a creature of the animal type, the creature is raised to humanlike sentience, as though by the awaken spell. Once this occurs, the collar loses its magical properties. If a collar of the true companion is worn for more than 1 week by a creature not of the animal type, the wearer is feebleminded until the collar is removed.]]></target>

Releasing the energy targets the wearer with the stored lay on hands effect, as if touched by the person who infused the crystal with its power. The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white light. The wearer of the crystal can order it to release its energy as a standard action.

The dragonfoe amulet is a powerful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons, improving the protection and attacks of the wearer in a number of ways. The wearer of a dragonfoe amulet ignores the damage reduction of dragons. This only affects actual dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result. Lastly, the wearer takes no damage instead of half damage on a successful Reflex save against a dragon's breath weapon (as the evasion ability).]]></target>

It provides a +2 armor bonus to AC (this does not stack with other armor bonuses) and grants the light fortification property to the wearer. In addition, the wearer may engrave a glyph of warding directly onto the guardian gorget. When the wearer is struck in melee, she can trigger the glyph as an immediate action, causing the glyph to discharge against the creature making the attack (and other creatures within 5 feet, if a blast glyph was placed, though the wearer is not harmed by the glyph's effects). The glyph can be triggered even if the attack would normally leave the wearer incapable of taking actions (such as killed, stunned, dazed, or knocked unconscious).]]></target>

The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half).

Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above. If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7).

When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals. Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above. If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

Seven of these jewels are larger than the rest. While wearing a necklace of netted stars, the wearer can create dancing lights at will and wandering star motes (see Advanced Player's Guide) once per day. In addition, each of the seven jewels of the necklace can recall a previously cast 1st-level or 0-level spell, as a pearl of power. Once per day, the wearer may use the necklace to catch a spell targeted at him, as if readying an action to counterspell using dispel magic, with a bonus on the check equal to 12 + the number of jewels not yet used to recall spells that day. If all jewels have been used, this ability cannot be used that day. The level of the spell to be countered must be less than or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its magical energy to recall a previously cast spell of the same level or lower as an immediate action. Whether or not the attempt succeeds, this action exhausts the power of all of the necklace's jewels for that day.]]></target>

When first given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and gender-but not a specific individual- as its owner. The owner automatically fails any saving throw made to resist the effects of divination magic, but the necklace seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet can cast (and when it does so) include freedom (in response to imprisonment, petrification, paralysis, and similar effects described by this spell), greater dispel magic (in response to any fear or mind-affecting effect), remove curse (in response to curses), protection from chaos (in response to any form of possession or similar control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target of these spells is always the wearer. The Invidian Eye can cast each spell 3 times per day. If the Invidian Eye is worn by a creature not of the race and gender it recognizes as its owner, it ceases to use its defensive properties. In addition, once every 1d6 days, the gem makes a self-destructive suggestion. The wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or make a casual attempt to harm herself during the course of the day. This suggestion does not dominate the wearer's actions, but she might be compelled to cut herself if she's wielding a weapon or jump if she passes a high window. If the wearer resists this compulsion three times in a row, the Invidian Eye takes more serious measures, conjuring a miniature prismatic sphere into the wearer's throat, which causes the wearer to begin suffocating (Core Rulebook 445). The sphere can only be removed by targeting the wearer with the same spells that normally remove a full size prismatic wall. The race and gender the Invidian Eye perceives as its owner can be reset by casting mage's disjunction upon the artifact, though this carries the normal risk of destroying the artifact. Whoever the necklace is next given to determines the artifact's new owner. The Invidian Eye is under the effects of a permanent nondetection spell. This affects only the artifact, not the wearer.]]></target>

This aspect takes the form of a wendigo (Bestiary 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour. Using the torc in this way alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts. In addition, anytime one of the Torc of Kostchtchie's powers is used, there is a cumulative 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious or dead, or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A necklace of strangulation appears to be a wondrous piece of magical jewelry. When placed on the neck, the necklace immediately tightens, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle, and remains clasped around the victim's throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately 1 month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.]]></target>

The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh, and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but she still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form.

They thus carry great social cachet with the Duskwardens, who consider selling or purchasing one to be a grave insult. A greater halflight charm is a dark blue crystal amulet embossed with a golden arch and suspended from a black cord. When worn, it grants the wearer darkvision 60 feet. It also grants a +2 bonus on all initiative checks made while in underground areas. In addition, once per year, the wearer can call on the amulet to summon the specific Duskwarden on whom the charm was imprinted at its creation, who is instantly teleported to an adjacent square along with his standard adventuring gear, provided the wearer is on the same plane. The Duskwarden is not bound to the caster's will in any way.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Slave collars are popular items among drow, duergar, and other Darklands societies that require obedience and servitude from slave castes. As these collars are relatively costly, they are typically reserved for use on particularly powerful or desirable slaves. A slave collar consists of a simple ring of metal (typically brass or bronze) that latches in place with a lock. Many feature additional adornments like short lengths of chain. Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature takes a -5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave collar's lock can be picked with a successful DC 40 Disable Device check, or broken open with a successful DC 30 Strength check-either method immediately destroys the slave collar. The wearer of a slave collar takes a -10 penalty on Disable Device or Strength checks made to disable the slave collar it wears.]]></target>

A mothman memento can be any item that is worn around the neck, such as an amulet or pendant. As a full-round action while wearing a mothman memento, a mothman can simultaneously kill itself and inject its soul into the item. A mothman memento can lie untouched for years or even decades before it winds up in the hands of another creature. Any humanoid or monstrous humanoid that wears the memento gains the ability to cast modify memory as a spell-like ability three times per day (caster level 12th). If a creature goes to sleep or falls unconscious while wearing a mothman memento, the wearer must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by a nightmare spell (no modifiers due to knowledge or physical connection; caster level 12th). A creature can be affected by this nightmare effect only once every 24 hours. After the first time the wearer is affected by the nightmare effect, the memento can only be removed by means of a remove curse spell. A creature that dies from the nightmare effect rises as a mothman the next morning.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A whispering amulet looks like a bejeweled glabrezu head to the person who owns it, but to anyone else appears to be a relatively unremarkable necklace. As long as it is worn, a whispering amulet masks the wearer's alignment as if by undetectable alignment. Once per day by grasping the amulet in one hand and whispering, as a standard action, the wearer may send a single message of no more than 25 words to another creature as if via sending-the message arrives at the intended target in the form of a soft whisper in the left ear, and the recipient can opt to whisper a return message to the wearer of the amulet. A single glabrezu is linked to each whispering amulet, and any message sent or received via the amulet can be heard by the demon as well. Finally, by grasping the amulet and whispering the glabrezu's name, the wearer can make a single wish. This destroys the whispering amulet, and as the wish itself is granted by the glabrezu, it likely has unexpected and unintended consequences. If the glabrezu has already used its wish ability during that month, the attempt to wish fails and the amulet is not destroyed- there's a 5% chance that this occurs if the GM doesn't already know for sure if the glabrezu's wish is available.]]></target>

While the noose is worn tightly around the neck, any time the wearer is reduced below 0 hit points he gains DR 10/- and fast healing 5 until he regains consciousness. While the wearer is unconscious, his breathing stops and he appears dead. If the wearer would be killed due to hit point loss while wearing the noose, he can expend any number of uses of mythic power to heal 10 hit points per use spent. This doesn't require an action. If that healing would bring him above the threshold for death, the wearer doesn't die.]]></target>

It ignores any wearer with an Intelligence score lower than 3, failing to meld or function. The necklace can be removed as a full-round action by concentrating on the tattoo to call the necklace back into existence. While in tattoo form, the amulet grants a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes (but not natural weapons) and provides the benefits of the ghost touch weapon special ability on unarmed strikes. As a swift action, the wearer can spend a ki point to make one unarmed strike-whether as a single attack or part of a full attack-an incorporeal touch attack. As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to become incorporeal for 1 round. This lasts until either just before his next turn (if used during his turn) or at the end of his next turn (if used outside his turn). While incorporeal, the wearer has no Strength score, so his Dexterity modifier applies to his melee attacks, ranged attacks, and combat maneuver checks. Since the necklace provides the ghost touch ability, the wearer can make unarmed strikes against corporeal creatures while incorporeal. The wearer can remain inside solid objects as long as he continues expending mythic power to remain incorporeal. If he fails to do so, he materializes inside the object and instantly dies.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This brittle human jawbone is all that remains of the legendary Chelish diplomat Galevius. A simple cord allows the relic to be worn as a necklace. The jawbone represents all of Galevius's substantial powers of negotiation. The power of the artifact is not in the jaw, but in the 16 teeth socketed into the bone. Upon donning the jawbone, the wearer understands all of its powers and limitations. As a standard action, the wearer may remove a tooth from the jawbone and crush it in an open hand to activate its powers. The jawbone does not function for an evil character; an evil wearer finds the teeth rooted too firmly in the bone to remove. When the Jawbone of the Venerable Galevius is first found, it contains a full set of 16 teeth. When a tooth is removed and crushed by the wearer, it provides the following effect for 1 hour, although an effect immediately ends if the wearer removes the jawbone or crushes another tooth. Incisors (4 teeth): These teeth are used for cutting; in a negotiation, an incisor represents an attack on an opponent's position. Crushing an incisor grants a +4 sacred bonus on Intimidate checks and attack rolls. Canines (2 teeth): Canines are used for tearing; in a negotiation, a canine represents a final, decisive strike in an argument. Crushing a canine grants a +4 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks. In addition, whenever the user improves a creature's attitude with the Diplomacy skill, the creature's attitude automatically improves by an additional step (but does not exceed helpful). Premolars (4 teeth): Premolars can perform multiple functions; in a negotiation, a premolar represents a careful shift of position. When crushed, a premolar grants a +4 sacred bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, the user does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving. Molars (6 teeth): These teeth are used for determined grinding; in a negotiation, a molar represents reasoned tenacity and persistence. Crushing a molar provides a +4 sacred bonus on Sense Motive checks and immunity to fatigue and exhaustion. Despite the brittleness of the teeth socketed into the jawbone, the jawbone itself cannot be broken. Once all 16 teeth have been used, the empty jawbone immediately disappears, reappearing elsewhere in the world where a new owner is likely to encounter it. A prospective owner must be good-aligned and ideally has several ranks in Diplomacy.]]></target>

At its basest, a mythic amulet of the Abyss functions as an unholy symbol to this demon lord as well as a phylactery of faithfulness. A mythic amulet of the Abyss grants its wearer all three of the demon lord's boons, regardless of the wearer's actual level. It grants all of the first boon's spell-like abilities at will. The amulet found in this adventure is associated with Baphomet, and as such it grants the following boons (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2 for details on other demon lords' boons): • Beast shape I, misdirection, and summon monster I at will. • Once per day, the wearer can change shape into a minotaur for 1 hour, gaining a +4 size bonus to Strength and taking a -2 penalty to Charisma. If the wearer is actually a minotaur, she can instead assume a humanoid form at will; this change of form does not alter the wearer's ability scores. • Extended maze 1/day. Additionally, the wearer of the amulet gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor, immunity to electricity and poison, and resistance 10 to acid, cold, and fire. Any lawful or good character who wears this amulet gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the amulet is worn. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they can't be overcome in any way as long as the amulet is worn.]]></target>

Since then, many others have duplicated the magic item, yet the original remains lost-though some say it still hangs about the neck of its undead master. When a noose of terminal embrace is placed around the neck, it immediately activates, tightening and dealing 2d4 points of damage at that moment. Removing the noose thereafter requires a full-round action and a successful DC 18 Strength check (with failure resulting in an additional 2d4 points of damage). While the noose is worn, its frayed end dangles a foot or so from the neck, but once per day if the wearer of the noose is successfully grappled by a Large or smaller creature, the wearer may will the noose's length to extend and lash out at the attacker. This allows the wearer to immediately attempt a grapple check against the attacker; if successful, he establishes the grapple on the attacker rather than the other way around, and the attacker's attempt automatically fails (although the attacker may attempt to grapple the wearer in the future).]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This mummified human hand comes from an honest man punished for a crime he didn't commit, and is dried and hung from a simple twine thong around the neck. The hand's scapegoat origins offer some protection to its wearer. When the wearer of a hand of the honest man is targeted by a curse or a misfortune effect such as a witch's misfortune or evil eye hex, the curse is instead transferred to the hand with no ill effects to the wearer. The hand retains the curse (even if it normally expires after a set duration) until the effect is removed with a remove curse spell or similar effect. A spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on her caster level check to remove a curse stored in a hand of the honest man. Removing a hand of the honest man while it holds a curse instantly transfers the curse to its wearer. A hand of the honest man can hold only one curse or effect at a time. If the wearer is targeted by another curse while the hand is currently storing a curse, the new curse takes effect normally. A hand of the honest man has no effect on curses already affecting a creature. The wearer of a hand of the honest man is riddled with guilt over any untruths she utters, and takes a -2 penalty on all Bluff checks while wearing the hand.]]></target>

A creature with the touch of corruption class ability that wears the choker of the Rough Beast increases the damage dice of that ability from 1d6 per 2 antipaladinAPG levels to 1d8 per 2 levels. Good-aligned creatures within 120 feet of the choker of the Rough Beast hear distant bellows of unimaginable rage, giving them a -2 penalty on all Perception checks as the sounds distract them. Within 30 feet of the necklace, the sound increases, and all good-aligned creatures must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be shaken while within range. They can attempt another save after 24 hours. If the wearer willingly breaks the choker in half (a fullround action), the ground under his feet ruptures open and consumes him (as the imprisonment spell). The blood of Rovagug seeps up from the wound in the earth 1d6 rounds after the wielder is consumed. Treat this as a fiendish carnivorous blob (Bestiary 2 51, 292) that attacks any living creature within sight. The hole seals immediately after the blood rises.]]></target>

Priests of Horus fashioned the first eye of Horus amulets centuries ago to protect members of their order, particularly from minions of the god Set. Now, the occasional eye of Horus amulet turns up in a marketplace or in the hands of nomadic traders or adventurers. An eye of Horus amulet grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, once per day, the wearer can surround herself with an aura of shimmering sunlight that protects her as dispel evil. Using this effect to drive an evil extraplanar creature back to its home plane or to end either an evil spell or an enchantment spell cast by an evil creature cancels this effect. Lastly, if the wearer of an eye of Horus amulet is targeted by an effect that causes blindness, she can, as an immediate action, cause the amulet to absorb the effect. The wearer suffers no harm from the effect, but the amulet cracks in half, rendering it forever useless thereafter.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This winged, golden cartouche hangs on a leather thong beaded with semi-precious stones. Normally, a cartouche of distinctive warding functions as a ring of protection +1 and allows the wearer to use shield two times per day. Once per day, the wearer can write the name of a specific individual in Ancient Osiriani hieroglyphs on the cartouche (the name must be the person's true name, not an alias, nickname, or title). This causes the cartouche's regular powers to go dormant, but for the next hour the wearer is protected against the inscribed individual in three ways: • The wearer gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC against all attacks made by the inscribed individual (including physical attacks, and magic items and spells that require attack rolls). • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and effects cast or created by the inscribed individual. • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on opposed skill checks against the inscribed individual. At the end of 1 hour, the inscribed name fades, and the cartouche loses all its powers for 23 hours. Note that the actions of the inscribed individual's allies (including minions or summoned creatures) are not subject to the cartouche's power.]]></target>

If the token of favor is broken apart and added to boiling water, it becomes a nourishing porridge that feeds up to eight Medium creatures. This meal cures all ongoing sickness and nausea effects, and provides the benefits of neutralize poison and remove disease. In addition, for 24 hours after eating the porridge, subjects gain a +2 luck bonus on Will saves against fear.]]></target>

If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk (although she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC).

This silver slender athame is deceptively plain, but has a treacherous past. It has been credited with deeds as noble as ending the life of the annis witch Traxyla of the Eye of Law (slain even as the blade's owner Ioella was beheaded by Madame Margaery) and as petty as the murder of Karian (loving mother and priestess of Sarenrae) by her estranged and vengeful husband. The blade of the willing martyr is a +3 keen vicious dagger, but its greatest power can only be invoked outside of battle. To activate this power you must spill your blood on your target, an object belonging to the target, or a physical token of the target's body (such as a few strands of hair). Your target gets a DC 23 Will save (using the same saving throw modifiers as the scrying spell for the owner's knowledge and connection to the victim) to avoid the effect, which forges a link between you and the target. Once you forge a link, your soul and the target's soul are intertwined. Should you die, your target dies, suffering the same apparent injuries and symptoms; likewise, you die if your target dies. The link may only be severed by break enchantment or remove curse.]]></target>

At that point, the wearer and all living creatures within a 20-foot radius must each make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid believing that they are actually some sort of undead creature for the next 24 hours. The GM can either roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5 ghouls, 6 vampire) or choose which sorts of undead the affected creatures believe themselves to be, customizing to the personality and abilities of each creature. Creatures affected by the armor behave as normal for the sorts of undead they regard themselves-"zombies" mindlessly attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to bite victims on the neck, and so on-but gain none of the special abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm "their" type of undead, so "vampires" avoid garlic, "wraiths" recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures otherwise continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they have but "their" type of undead normally lacks; for example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel energy and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures affected by gravesoul armor. This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of the armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it can only work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour period. Regardless of the curse, the armor is still +1 studded leather, and some characters may find it useful despite its (nonexistent) power over undead. Unlike most cursed items, this one is easily discarded without any magical assistance.]]></target>

Thereafter, the gown holds the magic for up to 24 hours, functioning as a spite spell against the next foe to strike the witch with a successful melee attack or combat maneuver.

Robes of Xin-Shalast aid and accentuate their wearer's spellcasting ability. They grant a +6 armor bonus and spell resistance 24, but also cause the wearer to cast all spells at +1 caster level. Two of the robe's pockets function as handy haversacks.

Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The "claws" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed. A suit of demon armor is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it.

                    <target><![CDATA[The warden of the woods is a suit of +3 greenwood splint mail made of strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer's movement but stiffen when struck in battle. (The greenwood special material is described on page 50.) This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of -4. As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders. The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the armor crumble into dust.]]></target>

Once per round, the wearer may add an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on one attack and damage roll for an unarmed strike or natural attack (for one specific attack, not all attacks made with an unarmed strike that round). The wearer may use this item an additional time per round when his BAB reaches +6, +11, and +16. Choosing to enhance an unarmed strike is not an action and may occur when it is not the wearer's turn (such as when making an attack of opportunity). The wearer must decide to use the item before the attack roll is made, but does not have to expend all uses at the same time. For example, if the wearer can use the item twice per round, he can use it once on his turn when making an attack and save the second for the possibility of making an attack of opportunity. Additionally, the bodywrap can grant melee weapon special abilities to a creature's unarmed attacks, so long as those special abilities to be added apply to unarmed attacks. See Table 3-8: Melee Weapon Special Abilities (page 137) for a list of abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. Any special abilities are set at the time of creation. A bodywrap of mighty strikes cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +7. Unlike an amulet of mighty fists, a bodywrap needs to have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special ability.]]></target>

Any time the eidolon would be forced to return to its home plane (such as when it's reduced to negative hit points equal to its Constitution score or when its master is rendered unconscious), it can expend one use of its summoner's summon monster spell-like ability as a free action to remain on the Material Plane for 1 round. The summoner does not need to be conscious for the eidolon to use this ability, but he must be within 100 feet. If the summoner is conscious, he can refuse to allow this expenditure (which means the eidolon is forced back to its home plane). If the condition that would have sent the eidolon back to its home plane is still in effect after 1 round has passed, the eidolon may expend another use of its master's summon monster spell-like ability; otherwise it immediately returns to its home plane.]]></target>

If the wearer is a spontaneous caster, once per day she may use a spell slot to cast a spell from a written source (such as a scroll or spellbook) as if she knew that spell. The spell must be on her spell list, the same spell level or lower than the expended spell slot, and the same type of spell (arcane or divine) as the spell slot expended. The caster must also understand the written source (such as using Decipher Script or read magic) and be carrying it. Activating the robe is not an action, but casting the spell otherwise works as normal, including casting time, providing components or foci, and so on. Using a mnemonic vestment's properties does not consume the written source.]]></target>

The kimono grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +4 bonus on all caster level checks. Once per day, the wearer can capture a single creature within 60 feet within the kimono (no save), shunting the victim into an extradimensional space similar to that created by a maze spell. Inside this otherworldly prison, the maze appears as an endless cherry orchard filled with "walls" of windblown cherry blossoms and cranes flying overhead. Each round on its turn, the victim inside the kimono may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the kimono as a full-round action. If the victim doesn't escape, it is released after 10 minutes, returning to where it had been before the kimono drew it in. If this location is occupied by another creature or a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Whenever a creature is drawn inside the kimono, the victim's image temporarily manifests as another embroidered design among the kimono's other images. While a victim is trapped inside, the kimono's bonuses on saving throws and caster level checks are increased by 2 (to +6). The kimono's increased bonuses return to normal when the victim is freed or released.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Appearing to be nothing more than a ratty wool robe with a hood, this garment is an invaluable tool for spies, thieves, and smugglers. On command, the wearer and non-living objects up to her maximum load are sucked into an extradimensional space within the robe, leaving the robe to collapse where the wearer was standing. The robe appears to be merely a pile of discarded clothes, and does not detect as magical or function so long as the wearer is within the extradimensional space. While inside the extradimensional space, the wearer cannot take most actions, but can breathe comfortably for up to 24 hours. The wearer can see the area around the robe, though special senses such as darkvision or blindsense do not function. The wearer may leave the extradimensional space with a thought as a free action-the only action he can make while inside the extradimensional space. He reappears wearing the robe once more. However, if there is not enough room for the wearer to reappear (for example, if the robe was placed inside a small box) then the wearer cannot leave the extradimensional space. If the robe is destroyed or its magic suppressed while the wearer is within the extradimensional space, or if he spends 24 hours within it, he and all objects inside reappear instantaneously in the robe's space, and the wearer is dazed for one round.]]></target>

At that point, the wearer and all living creatures within a 20-foot radius must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid believing that they are actually some sort of undead creature for the next 24 hours. The GM can either roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5 ghouls, 6 vampires) or choose which sorts of specific undead the affected creatures believe themselves to be. Creatures affected by the armor behave as normal for the sorts of undead they regard themselves as-"zombies" mindlessly attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to bite victims on the neck, and so on-but gain none of the special abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm "their" type of undead, so "vampires" avoid garlic, "wraiths" recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they have but "their" type of undead normally lacks; for example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel energy and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures affected by gravesoul armor. This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of the armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it can only work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour period. Regardless of the curse, the armor is still +1 studded leather, and some characters may find it useful despite its (nonexistent) power over undead. Unlike most cursed items, this one is easily discarded without any magical assistance.]]></target>

On command, an arcing torrent of water rises up from an existing body of water, allowing the mount to use its swim speed to move through the air. This functions as air walk and can be used a total of 7 minutes per day, usable in 1-minute increments. The arc of water trails behind the mount and rider and can be used by other swimming creatures to move through the air (Swim DC 15). When the effect ends, the suspended water disappears with a negligible amount of water falling on creatures underneath the path of the arc. The sky-river created by the saddle does not harm creatures, though it does extinguish nonmagical fires in areas it overlaps with them. As a standard action, the rider can expend 2 minutes of the sky-river's duration to produce a hydraulic torrentAPG with a CMB of +9.]]></target>

Each bell can be rung to produce its own effect, or all can be rung at once to create a death ward. The death warden's bandolier can be used three times per day. A mythic creature can expend one use mythic power to use the bandolier without expending one of the item's daily uses. Undead Ward Bell: This long, thin bell produces a high-pitched, piercing ring. When it is rung as a standard action, it creates a 30-foot-burst aura that keeps out undead creatures. An undead creature can't enter the aura unless it succeeds at a DC 16 Will save. Undead within the aura take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, skill checks, and ability checks. The aura lasts for 5 rounds, but can be extended to 1 minute by expending one use of mythic power. Channeling Bell: This large, bulbous bell creates a rich, reverberating tone. When it's rung as part of the action to channel positive energy to harm undead, it can take the place of the holy symbol needed for channeling. When it's used in such a manner, undead creatures within the area take an additional 2 points of damage per each die of the channelled energy. The undead take this extra damage even if they succeed at their Will saving throws. Dirge Bell: The final, largest bell is cone-shaped. It creates a deep, bass chime. When rung, this bell creates an aura in a 30-foot-radius burst that causes incorporeal undead within it to become semi-physical for a period of time. While within the aura, undead take half damage from nonmagical attacks and full damage from magical attacks. The aura last for 5 rounds, but can be extended to 1 minute by expending one use of mythic power. All Bells At Once: When all the bells are rung at once, the wearer and all of her allies within 30 feet are protected as if they were subject to a death ward spell (CL 11th). By expending one use of mythic power, the wearer can increase the duration of this effect to 24 hours.]]></target>

This effect lasts for 1 hour, during which time the wearer can go back and forth between wearing the robe inside out (disguising himself) and right side out (revealing his true form) any number of times. Witnesses to a creature wearing a liar's robe must use true seeing or a similar effect in order to pierce through this disguise; otherwise, they see the wearer only as a continually shifting humanoid form. The wearer's voice, scent, and other tangible cues are also continually altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as detect thoughts or locate creature) may still be used to recognize the individual. Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a liar's robe is typically used in circumstances when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning another identity or hiding her presence.]]></target>

Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can summon a swarm of locusts that surround her and support her weight during a fall, causing her to drift slowly down to the ground, similar to feather fall. While falling, the wearer can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot she falls, at a speed of 60 feet per round. The wearer takes no damage upon landing. The effect ends as soon as the wearer touches the ground or after 6 rounds, whichever comes first. If the effect expires while the wearer is still in the air, she falls the remaining distance as normal.]]></target>

The first time the wearer is struck in melee, the armor animates and begins crushing its wearer. On the round that the armor animates, it automatically grapples the wearer. In following rounds, at the beginning of the wearer's turn, the armor makes a grapple combat maneuver check (CMB +20) to constrict the wearer. If successful, the armor deals 2d6 points of damage each round. Once animated, the armor releases its grip only when it is destroyed or its wearer dies. The wearer can't physically remove the armor once it activates, but others can help destroy or remove it. This armor functions normally (without animating) when worn by unliving creatures such as constructs and undead.]]></target>

As a move action, the wearer can travel on the backs of the rats as they swim, moving up to 15 feet across the surface of calm waters. If surface conditions become worse than calm, the rats disperse and the wearer falls. On land, the swarm allows the wearer to ignore difficult terrain's effects on her movement for up to 15 feet of movement per round. The swarm can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments. If the wearer falls unconscious while rat-tread boots are active, on the wearer's next turn the swarm tries to move her away from the nearest foe, moving 5 feet before dispersing. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If such movement is impossible, the swarm disperses. The swarm is a normal rat swarm, except its area doesn't exceed that of the wearer and it can't move out of the wearer's space. The swarm disperses when the effect's duration ends or when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. Rat-tread boots grant the wearer immunity from the attacks of rat swarms, including their special attacks.]]></target>

The sack is, however, something entirely different and more insidious. It is-in fact, one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature. Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to "swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls them inside as a free action. The bag has CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free. The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A Chelish crux is similar to a bag of holding in that its interior space is larger than its exterior would suggest. When closed, a Chelish crux is a wooden and metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12) that measures about 6 inches in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune or image-in order to open the puzzle box, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time a rune is triggered in the correct order in this manner, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever a rune is triggered out of order, the light flashes into fire and inflicts 2 points of fire damage per currently lit rune on the person attempting to open the crux (Reflex DC 15 halves) and causes all lit faces to deactivate (forcing the process of opening it to start anew). Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the combination of runes to randomize to a new combination. You can simulate this puzzle for the PCs by determining the order in which the runes must be activated and then having the players stumble through the combinations, or you can allow a character a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box-each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at which point the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and causes 2 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 halves), plus 2 points for each failure. A Chelish crux can be forced open with damage or a DC 28 Strength check. The crux has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. If a crux is forced open in either of these two ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, inflicting 3d6+6 points of fire damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 halves). The fire damage affects any objects held within the crux as well. If forced open, the crux crumbles to ashes and any objects it contains appear on the ground at the site of the fiery burst. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically (this takes 3 consecutive full-round actions). Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit upon the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners as a move-equivalent action. The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. A Chelish crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects, but the physical size of each object is irrelevant-the sight of a crux folding up around a long polearm, for example, might make one assume the weapon was crushed and destroyed, but when the crux is next opened, the pole arm is unharmed. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish crux functions as a bag of holding for determining how long a living creature within can survive, or for what happens when the crux is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, page 500)]]></target>

In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body to be spoken to. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When it's lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke. At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak-a grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 346), save that the dead spirit receives a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can only be successfully subjected to a grave candle once-the burning of the candle "burns out" the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's parting from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit).]]></target>

Bisby first encountered this dye while visiting the royal courts of the Miracle Samurai during his early adventures as a Pathfinder. He made a point of returning with several bottles, and the decision served him well over the next several decades. Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer-the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye's nature. A single vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text. Once applied, truecolor dye is permanent, although it can be washed off with universal solvent.]]></target>

In addition to granting temporary hit points, the bearer of one or more of these bones is always aware of the presence of other bones of Founder Raccona within 50 feet. The bones also possess a mild drive to seek out their remaining pieces. Every time a character acquires a bone of Founder Raccona, she must make a Will save (DC 10 + the number of bones of Founder Raccona in her possession). Failure causes the character to have a dream of Founder Raccona that encourages her to seek out the other bones. This dream does not force the character to act, but suggests that seeking the remaining bones would be a benevolent act. Should all 32 bones of Founder Raccona ever be gathered together, they immediately crumble to dust and release Raccona's soul to the afterlife, losing all power.]]></target>

This bane effect remains the same for a wielder, regardless of how many times he's used the bow. Thus, for one user it might be a +2 bane vs. humanoids (humans) longbow, while for another it might be a +2 bane vs. dragons longbow. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow's bane effect. In addition, once per week, felhart's wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell mount. This creature takes the form of a lean, swift white elk that, despite its almost ghostly appearance, possesses the same statistics as a horse. This creature allows felhart's wielder to ride it, and serves loyally for up to 5 hours, vanishing at the end of this time. The mount will not allow any creature beside felhart's wielder to ride it unless the weapon's bearer succeeds at a DC 16 Handle Animal check. Even if this check succeeds, the mount only allows another rider to ride along with the weapon bearer. The elk never allows a strange rider to ride it alone.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This painted silk kite depicts a shining golden dragon. In an area with 40 feet or more of vertical space and in conditions of light to moderate wind, a golden dragon kite can be unfolded and raised into the air as a full-round action. The user can direct the kite to move up to 100 feet from him in a single turn (but no farther). Three times per day, the kite can cast burning hands. The spell originates from the kite but acts as normal in all other ways. This spell can only be reproduced while the kite is flying, a process that takes 1 minute to achieve. Rumors say that in Minkai, versions of these kites exist that deliver other spells at great range.]]></target>

Anyone reading the journal for an hour or more has strange dreams the following night, the details of which he cannot remember. The following day the character is fatigued. Reading the journal for a total of 24 hours or more causes the reader to have a prophetic dream wherein he sees his own death-though, as before, he cannot remember the details. If a character who has had this vision comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second roll, regardless of its outcome. Once a character has had the opportunity to avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more benefit and never aids the character again. The Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer is affected by a permanent magic aura that makes it appear to be nonmagical.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Typically found in sets of three, these clay jars are decorated with the heads of animals and monsters. Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Souls within Osirian spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.]]></target>

If its wielder worships Asmodeus, the glaive uses bleed on any of its wielder's foes it notices is dying, and grants divine favor on a wielder who commands it to do so. If the wielder doesn't worship Asmodeus, the glaive uses bleed on any dying creature it notices and only grants divine favor against chaotic or good foes-if a wielder commands it to not use bleed in a battle or commands it to grant divine favor against a nongood or nonchaotic foe, a personality conflict occurs and the glaive attempts to gain control of the wielder.]]></target>

The teeth themselves typically take the form of tiny dragon teeth, though some appear to come from a serpent, wolf, or human. When a tooth is cast upon the earth as a standard action, a spartolos under the user's command erupts on the following round. The spartolos lasts for 1 hour or until destroyed. A spartolos's equipment vanishes if its owner is destroyed or after an hour. These seeds are typically found in simple pouches of leather or velvet containing 2d4 teeth. Up to six seeds can be sown by a single standard action.]]></target>

The eye is a socket for an ioun stone; when filled, you may activate the wayfinder when you sleep or meditate to create a mobile illusory image of yourself that is partly real. You control the image as if it were your own body and perceive things through it as if it had all of your normal senses plus darkvision with a range of 60 feet. You do not need to maintain line of sight to the image. The image is visible but transparent, and it cannot perform any action that an unseen servant is unable to perform. The image has 40% of your hit points at the time it was created. Its AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. It uses your current Will saving throw bonus but automatically fails Fortitude and Reflex saves. It is destroyed if brought to 0 hit points, which deals you 2d4 points of Charisma damage. It can be dispelled, and cannot enter areas warded against summoned creatures, your alignment, illusions, or incorporeal creatures. You may end this ability as a free action, and it ends automatically if you are awakened, your body is attacked, or 8 hours pass; ending the image in this manner does not deal you Charisma damage. Using this ability drains energy from the slotted ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless for 24 hours. A dull gray ioun stone cannot power the projection ability of this wayfinder. The wayfinder can still have synergistic powers granted by an ioun stone, though they do not function while the slotted stone is powerless.]]></target>

Detect magic does not detect that it is magical (as per the magic aura spell), but the pouch acts as a very small bag of holding (contents limit 10 pounds, volume limit 2 cubic feet). With a command word, the wearer can close or open the extradimensional space within the pouch; when closed, the pouch holds no more than a mundane belt pouch the size of a human fist, though objects within the extradimensional space remain stored, unreachable until the pouch is unsealed again. This allows the user to empty his pockets or even turn the pouch inside-out to prove he carries no contraband, and access the hidden goods later when in a safe place. Because of their nonmagical auras, these pouches sometimes hold secret treasures for generations without their owners realizing their nature.]]></target>

The stone can remove itself from a wayfinder to attack you in this fashion. The attack automatically wakes a sleeping character.

                    <target><![CDATA[This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain power out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way. The specimens in the Vaults are carefully locked in lead boxes to prevent them from draining the powers of other stored ioun stones.]]></target>

So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use. Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.]]></target>

All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Ivory Goats: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function: • The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week-continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. • The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. • The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.]]></target>

Obsidian Steed: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the nearformless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand's special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list. Special Bead Type Special Bead Ability Bead of blessing Wearer can cast bless. Bead of healing Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/ deafness, or remove disease. Bead of karma Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. Bead of smiting Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial). Bead of summons Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a geas upon him as punishment at the very least.) Bead of wind walking Wearer can cast wind walk. A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking. Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person. The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing -600 gp, bead of healing -9,000 gp, bead of karma -20,000 gp, bead of smiting -16,800 gp, bead of summons -20,000 gp, bead of wind walking -46,800 gp.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A bag of concealment appears to be a common leather sack with a shoulder strap, about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag behaves as a bag of holding, with all the same carrying capacities according to size, except for a few key points. Each bag of concealment is keyed to a specific owner upon creation (and can only be keyed to one person at a time)-should the bag's owner be killed, it becomes keyed to the next person to open it (the currently keyed person can also relinquish this status as a standard action, allowing another creature to become keyed to the bag by opening it). Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag's outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag's magical pocket dimension. Should anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new item is removed. A bag of concealment registers as nonmagical unless successfully identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura. The mouth of a bag of concealment can be stretched to up to four times its normal width, so larger goods may be hidden inside.]]></target>

Golden runes run the length of the staff, twisting into new configurations as its various powers are used.

If the wielder of the staff of the scholar uses its retributive strike ability and successfully travels to another plane of existence, he always arrives in the abode of a god of knowledge (though not necessarily a friendly one).]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A long wooden staff shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Unlike a normal staff, a staff of the magi holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. A staff of the magi does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers do not use charges: • Detect magic • Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates) • Hold portal • Light • Mage armor • Mage hand The following powers drain 1 charge per usage: • Dispel magic • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) • Ice storm • Invisibility • Knock • Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) • Passwall • Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates) • Wall of fire • Web These powers drain 2 charges per usage: • Monster summoning IX • Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates) • Telekinesis (400 lbs. maximum; Will DC 19 negates) A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A soul jar appears as a 1-foot-tall glass jar, often with a thick, black, wax plug. While a soul jar has no ability to capture souls, it can function as the material component for a trap the soul spell (but not as a focus for soul bind). If a soul jar is used with trap the soul as a trigger object, the spell can be cast on the soul jar without inscribing the target's name. This allows the soul jar to capture the soul of the next person to touch it, allowing the jar to be used as a devious trap. The creator of the soul jar and nonliving creatures can manipulate such a soul jar without fear. This variant method does allow the victim a DC 22 Will save to resist the effect. When a creature is trapped in a soul jar, its body and soul appear as a roiling cloud of glowing white smoke that provides dim light in a 20-foot radius. A creature that touches an occupied soul jar can communicate telepathically with its occupant. Opening a soul jar or smashing it on the ground releases the stored soul and returns it to life-although victims who have spent hundreds of years in a soul jar may well have gone mad. In any event, once a soul jar is used to capture a soul, it can never again be used for this purpose. Most soul jars are worth 5,000 gp and can thus trap a soul of up to 5 HD. Soul jars can be built to capture more powerful souls, at an increase of 1,000 gp per additional HD.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[An oculus of Abaddon is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre- Earthfall race that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen. An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage as the initial plucking). An oculus placed in an empty eye socket immediately heals all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus allows its new owner to utilize its powers, as listed below. • Darkvision to a range of 120 feet (constant) • True seeing once per day as a free action • Greater scrying three times per day • Planar binding once per week (only to summon natives of Abaddon, such as daemons or soul eaters) • Familiar farsight at will (if the user has a familiar or an animal companion, he may use clairaudience/clairvoyance to observe the world through his familiar, despite any intervening distance as long as he and the familiar are on the same plane) The oculus of Abaddon's greatest power, though, is its haunting beckon. This ability is usable once per year, and allows the user to manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as mass charm monster, but with a range of 1 mile, and establishes a telepathic link between the caster and all minds in that area. The effects are still language-dependant despite this telepathy-creatures without the ability to understand language (typically, creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower) are unaffected. All other creatures are automatically affected unless they have 6 or more HD, in which case they gain a DC 22 Will save to resist the effects. Spell resistance applies regardless of HD. The oculus of Abaddon is powerfully neutral evil and possesses a limited and hateful intellect of its own. While not capable of communicating directly with its owner, it refuses to activate its powers for any user who is not neutral evil.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Fashioned from soft yet still quite durable lambskin, this piece of parchment gives a faithful divine spellcaster of a specific religion a hint about what spell may be useful for that day. Each day, when the owner prepares spells in the presence of the guiding vellum, the name of one specific divine spell which the owner already has the ability to cast appears on its surface. This represents a spell which should prove useful for the tasks in the next 24 hours. Each guiding vellum is associated with one level of divine spells and only shows a spell of that level. For example, if a cleric caster has a 3rd-level vellum and the GM expects the character to face invisible opponents later that day, the vellum shows the name "invisibility purge" (a 3rdlevel cleric spell); if the opponents are using poison and the cleric has a 2nd-level vellum, it would show the name "delay poison." A caster can only use one vellum of a particular spell level each day (using two 1st-level vellums gives the same result), but using vellums of different spell levels works normally. Each vellum works only once per day.

Pushing any of the buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. Unless otherwise stated, pressing a button a second time reverts the rod to its basic form. The following functions have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. Brace/jack: The end caps flatten into 2-foot-diameter discs and the wooden haft extends up to 10 feet, creating a brace for a tunnel ceiling or lifting a heavy object 10 feet into the air. Bridge: The rod flattens and extends to 1 foot wide, 1 inch thick, and 12 feet long. This form can support 4,000 pounds. Climbing pole/ladder. A spike that can anchor in stone extrudes from one end, while the other sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Crowbar: This functions like a normal crowbar. Drill: One metal cap extends to a drill-like point and begins to spin, easily drilling a 3-inch-diameter hole through 3 feet of wood or 1 foot of stone per minute. Mallet: Though not intended as a weapon, a character can attack with the rod in this form as if it were a Medium warhammer with a -2 penalty. Portable ram: This functions like a normal portable ram, except up to three people are needed to help the wielder. Saw: This works like a normal two-person saw. Shovel: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form. Wedge: One metal cap extends to form a flat chisel shape, such as for cutting wood or breaking stone (normally a hammer or mallet is used with it for this task).]]></target>

The interior can be lit on command, and can be adjusted from normal darkness as per the spell light. Occupants inside the tent cannot be seen, heard, or smelled by creatures outside. The temperature inside the expedition pavilion is 70 F if the exterior temperature is between 0 and 100 F. For every degree the exterior temperature is below 0 or above 100, the interior temperature decreases or increases, respectively, by 1. The pavilion also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The pavilion withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it. The pavilion can only be set up once per day, requiring 10 minutes to erect or dismantle. The tent cannot be dismantled while foreign objects are still inside, though if the pavilion is destroyed, any creatures and objects inside immediately spill out.]]></target>

Designed to aid in the crafting of potions and admixtures, a blackwick cauldron grants a +5 competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks and a +5 bonus on Spellcraft checks to create magic potions with the Brew Potion feat. Additionally, a cauldron allows a user to craft multiple potions at a faster rate than normal. The user can craft a single potion with a value of 300 gp or less in 2 hours and can make any combination of potions totaling 1,200 gp or less in value in a single day. In addition to its crafting uses, a blackwick cauldron can cast identify once per day on an item placed inside of it. A blackwick cauldron can also be used as a focus or inexpensive material component for spells of the divination school, such as clairaudience/clairvoyance or prying eyes, as long as such focus or material component has a cost of 5 gp or less.]]></target>

On a critical hit, Chada's harpoon lodges into the target's flesh or armor, and the wielder can choose to pull the target toward him, reeling the victim in by use of the magically extended chain. This functions as the pull universal monster ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 303) with the following exceptions. Compare the initial attack roll (instead of a new CMB check) to the target's CMD to determine success. Success pulls the target 20 feet closer to the wielder. The wielder can make additional attack rolls each round (instead of new CMB checks) to pull the victim closer. Unlike the normal pull ability, Chada's harpoon can pull creatures of any size. Once the target is pulled adjacent to the wielder, the bull rush ends.]]></target>

If the advanced giant frog is slain, the emerald frog cannot be activated again for 1 full week. Each poisonous frog that is slain in combat reduces the total duration that the figurine can be activated for the week by 4 hours. Either the giant frog or the poisonous frogs can be used as combatants or as small, unintelligent servant-creatures, performing minor tasks or fetching small objects.

The window melds ever so slightly into the surface, allowing it to ignore minor protrusions, curves, or anything else that would normally make it difficult to simply lay down a pane of glass. On command, the front of this glass displays all activities on the other side of this surface like a window, piercing wood, earth, or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal. The window does not reveal its existence to non-hostile creatures depicted within it, allowing observers to study them at their leisure. However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window presents its owner and anyone looking through the window with an artificial image of the other side designed to lull them into a sense of false confidence- enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While presenting this image to those in front of the mirror, it reveals those viewers to the enemies being observed, creating a two-way window; however, viewed creatures see those using the mirror accurately and can read their thoughts as if using detect thoughts. Furthermore, the image shown to those using the mirror does not reveal that the creatures they are watching can see them as well. Once the curse activates, the owner comes to regard using the mirror to spy ahead as his most effective tactic (after all, it has no limit to its duration) and does so whenever possible until curse-breaking magic frees him from its influence (anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles, even if he wasn't the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to this desire to continue using it).]]></target>

Once he does, he discovers that rather than quenching the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter his body. This flame persists inside of him for the next 24 hours, causing minor discomfort and giving him the sickened condition, but causing no visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a flammable object or structure, he feels inclined to set the object ablaze, using whatever means at his disposal. Each round the wielder resists this urge, he takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within him surges and roils. After 1 minute of this, he must make a DC 15 Will save or succumb to the temptation; if he saves, the urge passes, the internal fire stops harming him, and he can interact normally with the flammable target thereafter. Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid using it to extinguish or suppress any fire he encounters which he himself did not start. He cannot use the rod against fires that he personally started. Successful curse-breaking magic allows the wielder to get rid of the rod and harmlessly dissipates any fire persisting inside him from the action of the rod.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A talisman of reluctant wishes appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a talisman of reluctant wishes must make a DC 15 Charisma check. If the check fails, the talisman acts as a stone of weight (see page 543 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears. If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like. The artifact grants one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.) Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.]]></target>

The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a wizard of tremendous power and wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle for all time. The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its inhabitants still bound. A would-be wielder of the Bottle of the Bound must know three secret commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can be removed; the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment, to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use the bottle like a summon monster IX spell at will, except only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial summoned creatures' destruction or return. No known force can open the bottle without the Word of Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word of Binding, its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level creatures and moving on to higher-level ones, until they all escape. If one of the Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of Banishment being uttered, it is free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The Words to use the Bottle of the Bound have been lost for uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least one or two of them.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of-or unable to tap into-its fantastic power. This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. Though created by the legendary Storm King millennia ago, the cloud castle has had several masters since he mysteriously disappeared over a thousand years ago. Many believe the Storm King ascended to godhood, while others believe he was captured and imprisoned by a rival, a demon lord, or even a deity wishing to remove a threat, which may mean that the Storm King will one day return to reclaim his castle. In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can only view places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has been known to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities: • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability. • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower. • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet). • Wind wall at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.]]></target>

During the item's creation, the creator must choose a humanoid creature to bind the doll to. This requires the creator to obtain and craft a bit of the intended target's body-typically hair, blood, or a tooth- into the fetish. Once this has been done, the ganji doll affects no other creature aside from the bound target. The target of the ganji doll cannot be changed after crafting is complete. Once the doll has been created, three times per day, any bearer can employ the doll to create any one of the following effects. These effects only target the creature bound to the doll. The target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against these effects. Blind: Covering the doll's head with a cloth blinds the target for 1 minute (DC 16 Will save to resist). Damage: Stabbing the doll with a sharp instrument, waving it over an open flame, wrapping a cord around the doll's neck, or otherwise damaging the doll causes the target to take 3d6 points of damage (DC 16 Fortitude save for half). This damage ignores all resistances and immunities. Target: The ganji doll functions as the bound target itself for the purpose of any spell with a range of touch. The target receives the effect of any spell cast upon the doll (up to the doll's limit of 3 effects per day) as if the caster had actually touched him. The target may make saving throws against such spells, if allowed, as normal, but takes the -2 penalty imposed by the doll. Beneficial spells, such as cure light wounds, can also be used in this manner.]]></target>

The demonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between razor-edged covers of cold iron. Care must be taken when opening this book, lest the covers cut the fingers. Blood spattered on the pages of the book quickly fades away, as if the damp sheets of pale parchment within possessed a thirsty, vampiric nature. A DC 12 Reflex save is enough to avoid being cut when opening this book-on a failed save, the user takes 2 points of Constitution damage. This section of the Book of the Damned serves as a catalogue of the Abyssal realms and their lords-yet just as the rulers of the Abyss wax and wane, the contents of this book shift and change as well, revealing dark secrets. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not chaotic evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward chaotic evil. These pages of the Book of the Damned are written in Abyssal. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the arcane spells listed below. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the Abyss are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within the Abyss always brings the caster to the exact location desired. The demonic section of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract chaotic evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with chaotic evil creatures. Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, desecrate, greater planar binding, insanity, rift of ruin (see page 48), summon monster VII, or unholy blight. Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can use the book to gain any one of the boons granted by any demon lord-the boon lasts as long as the owner retains possession of the book, or until she chooses a new boon. This does not require an obedience.]]></target>

Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The ancient Azlanti created the celestial lens to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars. Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing energy blasts focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around the sun temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning.]]></target>

Geyser: If four or more levels' worth of spells are cast upon the Aqualinth, the artifact is capable of causing the water surrounding it to purify and multiply, generating thousands of gallons of water. At the same time, it creates an effect mimicking reverse gravity upon the water, causing it to shoot up in a geyser capable of reaching a thousand feet high. Moments later, the effect passes; the water comes crashing down, and can be captured or diverted in the process, though the water level of the original supply remains unchanged. Bath of the God-Kings: Bathing in a pool infested by the Aqualinth instantly refreshes the bather, removing any fatigued or exhausted conditions. In addition, the bather is treated as though he were wearing a ring of sustenance for the next 4 months. Regular bathing for 56 days results in a +1 increase to a single ability score of the bather's choice-a creature can receive this bonus only once, but can continue to receive the other benefits of bathing in the pool. Liquid Ones: Anyone who spies her own reflection in a pool infested by the Aqualinth and who is not completely loyal to the Four Pharaohs of Ascension is treated as though she had gazed into the reflective surface of a mirror of opposition. The duplicates created by the Aqualinth are not truly identical to their originals. A duplicate has vulnerability to fire, losing any fire resistance or immunity the original may have, and also gains the water subtype. A duplicate can be distinguished from the original with a DC 30 Perception check, as the duplicate has a faint watery texture to its skin. Whispering Water: Possessed of a malign and alien intellect, the Aqualinth has an unknown agenda of its own, and is capable of casting suggestion (save DC 31) upon anyone who drinks at least half a gallon of water it has touched or produced.]]></target>

While seated upon the throne, a divine caster who worships Ydersius may use a spell slot or exchange any prepared divine spell (including domain spells) of 3rd level or higher to cast dispel magic. Once per day, a divine caster of sufficient level may instead cast greater dispel magic in place of a spell of 6th level or higher. This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of clerics and druids (see the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), but may also be employed by antipaladins, inquisitors, oracles, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius. The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius. This negative level remains as long as the non-sentient or heretical creature sits upon the throne and disappears when the throne is vacated. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the throne is occupied.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The skull of Ydersius is far more than just a powerful artifact-it is the actual skull of a god. The skull itself is all but indestructible, and while it can observe the world around it, its capacity to interact with that world is limited. Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from their prayers, granted by this very skull regardless of its location or who might claim the skull as their own-there is no way a mortal can block this effect. Relatively bulky, the skull itself measures nearly 5 feet long. The skull's greatest power is that it contains a god, and if reunited with the god's missing body, it can restore Ydersius to full potency as a deity. Beyond this staggering power, though, possession of the skull of Ydersius grants several powerful abilities, as outlined below. • The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (dimensional anchor and bane). • Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make a DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to a feeblemind spell. • All reptilian creatures (including all worshipers of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids currently wildshaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10. Any good-aligned creature that carries the skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A totem of Angazhan is a dangerous and sinister artifact created by the demon lord Angazhan-originally, only one such totem existed, but as the reach of the Gorilla King expanded, additional totems began to appear in various hidden parts of the Mwangi Expanse, especially to the south of the Screaming Jungle in the deep, unexplored center of Garund. Each totem of Angazhan possesses a crude intelligence and can observe the world around it via true seeing. It can also hear and possesses tremorsense. All three of these senses extend to a range of 30 feet; the totem cannot detect anything beyond this range. A totem of Angazhan constantly radiates an aura of fear that fills the minds of any creatures within 30 feet with cruel memories of past lives in which they were consumed alive by apes-whether or not these past deaths are accurate is irrelevant to the sensation of horror they invoke in victims. All non-worshipers of Angazhan within this area must make a DC 15 Will save each round to avoid becoming panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Once per round, a totem of Angazhan can cast weird. This is its primary means of defense, and it can target all creatures within 30 feet that it can sense. The effect manifests at caster level 20th, and has a save DC of 23. Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a Chaotic Evil charau-ka. A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a Chaotic Evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor continues ruling as the Gorilla King for another year. In this fashion, the Mwangi Expanse has never gone for more than several months without a Gorilla King for the past several hundred years. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to Chaotic Evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King). If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.]]></target>

Within the vial roils a small wisp of white vapor, churning as if caught in a miniature vortex of air. To capture a haunt's energies within a haunt siphon, you need only twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action)-this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt's area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt. If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green-if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. It may take multiple haunt siphons to destroy powerful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized by a haunt siphon takes a -5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes. A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the haunt siphon hits takes 1 point of negative energy damage from the splash.]]></target>

Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist-brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this "board" can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface-it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette's surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board-at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the seance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with "yes," "no," or "maybe," or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day-the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a -2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient-the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically "maybe."

Virulent acid constantly seeps from Blackaxe's blade, dealing +1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical hit, Blackaxe deals an additional +2d10 points of acid damage. Once per minute, the weapon's wielder can use heal on himself by striking a living and nonmagical tree with Blackaxe-this act causes the tree to wither to ash in a heartbeat. Treerazer can call Blackaxe to his hand as a free action, despite any intervening distance, as long as Blackaxe is not kept in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. The nascent demon lord often loans Blackaxe to favored minions, and uses this ability to reclaim his weapon should he become aware that the wielder has failed in a mission. While Blackaxe is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location and status (as via the status and discern location spells), and by concentrating can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses. While in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link, treating Blackaxe as if it were the source of the spell-like ability. Each time Treerazer does so, Blackaxe's wielder must make a DC 25 Will save to avoid being staggered for 1 round from the flow of power. These spell-like abilities trigger during the wielder's turn in initiative, but do not consume any of the wielder's actions in that round.]]></target>

The final blades were originally designed to provide a condemned prisoner a swift and painless death, but also to prevent the resurrection of said victim by trapping her soul within the guillotine's blade upon execution. Every blade has a unique appearance and citizens speak of them as if they are people. In speaking of a condemned prisoner, someone might say, "He'll lie with Bloody Jaine before the sun falls." Only Large or smaller helpless (or willing) creatures can be executed by a final blade. When a final blade scythes down to decapitate the target, treat this as a coup de grace attempt on the victim that inflicts 6d6+12 points of damage. A final blade's damage penetrates all damage reduction (save epic damage reduction) and negates all regeneration effects. A creature slain by this effect is immediately targeted by a soul bind effect that automatically places her soul into the blade itself (no save). A final blade has no limit to the number of souls it can hold. It is possible to release a soul from a final blade to allow that creature to be resurrected, but the ritual involved is a closely guarded secret known only to the Gray Gardeners.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[During the battle between the Whispering Tyrant and General Arnisant, the lich unleashed terrible magic upon the outnumbered mortal army. Despite the lich's power, Arnisant was protected from the onslaught by his magical shield, an artifact known as the Shield of Aroden. When the two finally faced off, the Whispering Tyrant attempted to use a wish to summon Arnisant's heart to his waiting claws. The Shield of Aroden prevented this dire fate and instead shattered into a dozen fragments, one of which appeared in Tar-Baphon's hand, fusing with the undead flesh and burning the lich with holy fire. When the flames subsided, the crippled lich was soon locked away in the dungeons beneath Gallowspire, there to rot for all eternity. The Shield of Aroden lost all of its power. Its broken remnants have been passed down from one watcher-lord to another without fail. Some say that should the Whispering Tyrant ever become free, the missing piece of the shield would have to be recovered from his bony claw for the fiend to truly be defeated. This item is normally kept on display in the city of Vigil in Lastwall, though at first glance it is just a collection of wooden shards on a large black silk pillow. If assembled, these 12 shards would form a round shield with a piece in the center missing. The shield's face is carved to look like Aroden's holy symbol-a winged eye in a circle. Originally known as the Shield of Aroden, most today call it by its new name-the Shattered Shield of Arnisant. If restored to its former glory (a task that could in and of itself be a campaign), the Shattered Shield becomes the Shield of Aroden once again-a +5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield. Once per day, you can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage like a flame strike (it is likely that this ability is what burned the lich in his final battle). Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, you can use the shield to redirect the attack to yourself, suffering all effects from that attack as if you were its intended target. All allies within 100 feet of you gain the effect of bless and prayer. As with a status spell, all allies within 100 feet know your relative position and condition. The Shield of Aroden bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. The negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature holds or carries the shield.]]></target>

A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing-it restores youth. A creature that drinks the elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age is randomly determined using Table 7-1 on page 169 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time). Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in Thuvia (except by the formula's creator). Each vial of sun orchid elixir requires six mature sun orchids and 1 month's time to ferment, although the exact formula used is a secret known only to the denizen of Alchemist's Keep in Thuvia. Prices for a dose of the elixir vary wildly since the elixir is sold at auction, but no dose has ever sold for less than 50,000 gp.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[When the Worldwound destroyed the nation of Sarkoris, the faithful of Iomedae seized upon the event as a balm against the horror of Aroden's death. The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of wardstones stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound. The primary purpose of the wardstones is to contain the growing influence of the Worldwound itself, but they also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a forbiddance spell. A single wardstone exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound), they create a 300-footwide path of forbiddance, with the wardstones running down the middle. The forbiddance area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further effect as well-focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat. The arrangement of the wardstones along the Mendev, Numeria, and Ustalav borders is such that even the unwarded borders to the west and north work to hamper demonic incursions.]]></target>

Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act. Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf 's skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.]]></target>

Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it refers to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction. Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 539), along with the following additional powers. Bite: As a standard action, Chomper's possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any target within a 5-foot radius. The possessor targets a single creature or unattended item with this attack. Chomper (not the wielder) makes a single bite attack against the creature or item targeted: bite +14 (1d10+5 and bleed 2). This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, despite the quasit's Tiny size. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities-Azrikalis cannot modify his attack roll with his Dexterity modifier, for example, nor can he use Chomper to make sneak attacks. Hateful Curse: When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If Chomper manages to seize control of a non-demon host through personality conflict, it directs its host to seek out victims to feed to it.]]></target>

The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux's wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack-passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user's hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a marionette crux lasts for a day, but additional uses of the crux can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely.

To apply the effects of a metamagic gem to a spell, you need only use the metamagic gem as an additional material component for the spell in question. When you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using a metamagic gem, the spell slot of the altered spell does not change. You may only use one metamagic gem on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be further enhanced by a metamagic rod, it can be used with spells already enhanced in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. Use of a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat. A sorcerer or other spontaneous spellcaster must still take a fullround action when using a metamagic gem, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses (except for quickening diamonds, which can be used as a swift action). The metamagic gems presented here are not the only such gems that exist.

                    <target><![CDATA[A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. The mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this grisly manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes. A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points-cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from whom the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation-the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.]]></target>

Each setting matches symbols inscribed on objects of great importance to the cult, such as statues, paintings, and doors. The proper arrangement of these runes activates stored spell effects in such objects, including powerful wards, programmed images, or the release of arcane locks. The bearer of a moribund key can cast message at will, and spectral hand and vampiric touch 3 times per day. In addition, the skull's eyes glow when undead approach within 60 feet. A moribund key bestows one negative level on any good creature carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the medallion is carried and cannot be overcome in any way while the medallion is in that creature's possession.]]></target>

Anyone who drinks the concoction gains 1d10+3 temporary hit points for 1 hour. In addition, an enslaved vampire or vampire spawn who drinks the elixir is freed from its creator's control for 1 hour, becoming a free-willed undead creature for that time. At the end of the hour, the vampire is once again enslaved under its creator's control. Bloodbrew elixir is highly addictive to vampires, and any vampire who drinks it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted to the bloodbrew. Thereafter, the vampire must drink a new dose of bloodbrew every day, or take a -2 penalty to Dex, Con, Str, and Wis and lose her fast healing ability, until a new dose is taken. The addiction can only be cured with greater restoration, or the vampire must make three consecutive saves, one per day, against the elixir's DC, after a day of not taking the drug. Should the vampire take a new dose of the elixir before the addiction is cured, any past successful saves are negated. A living creature who drinks the elixir gains the temporary hit points, but takes a -2 penalty on saves against energy drain and negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy, for 1 hour. Bloodbrew elixir is not addictive to living creatures.]]></target>

The Gem of Dreams can be used once per month to absorb the dreaming mind of any sleeping creature it is in contact with-this ability must be activated as a full-round action. The sleeping creature can resist this doom by making a DC 20 Will save-with a success, he is afflicted by a nightmare spell (CL 20th) but is otherwise unharmed. If he fails the save, his dreaming mind is stolen, warped, and then siphoned back into his body in the space of an hour. If the victim is awakened before this process completes, his body twists and transforms into a creature known as a dream eater (see above), at which point only wish or miracle (or the destruction of the Gem of Dreams) can restore him to his true form. At the point the transformation occurs, the creature that activated the gem's power ceases to age for a month. By using the gem every month (and creating more and more dream eaters), a person can effectively become immortal in this manner. While this is technically nothing more than a beneficial side effect, it is this power that has generated the majority of the gem's legendary fame.]]></target>

These effects stack with each other-the second time the victim succumbs, he becomes frightened. The third time, he is panicked and drops the deadflesh waraxe in his attempt to flee. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This flaw is relatively subtle-in order to notice it when identifying the item, the examiner must exceed the DC 27 Spellcraft check by 10 points or more. In the hands of a soldier ready to deal with this imperfection, a deadflesh waraxe can be a powerful tool against the undead, but many of the dwarven defenders of the mines weren't made aware of the flaw until it was too late.]]></target>

Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future. The Amatatsu Seal has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast heal on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal's discretion, it can cast resurrection on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month. The Amatatsu Seal itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its warding box, for as long as the warding box is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it. The repercussions of this are detailed in later adventures in the Jade Regent Adventure Path. One final ward exists on the Amatatsu Seal, confounding attempts to whisk it quickly away from its homeland but also making returning a stolen seal home an arduous task. The Amatatsu Seal can never be transported by teleportation magic or dimensional travel. It cannot be taken from the Material Plane save via special portals blessed by the gods, and characters who carry the seal cannot cast or otherwise use teleportation effects.]]></target>

Once per day, a single command causes this block of wood to unfold in the space of 1 round into an exquisite writing desk sized for a Small or Medium author, complete with four vials of ink, two writing quills, and 50 blank sheets of paper. The desk creates new supplies of ink, quills, and paper each time it is unfolded. Once the desk is unfolded, it creates a 20-footradius hemisphere centered on the desk's location-this effect is identical to that created by a tiny hut spell. Once activated, the desk's tiny hut effect lasts for up to 10 hours or until the desk is folded up or moved more than a few inches. Of course, the effect also works to provide an ideal spot for a campsite, and in most parties a field scrivener's desk is used solely for this effect.]]></target>

If a vial of alchemist's fire is in the explosion pocket when it is commanded to create a vial of alchemist's fire, the pocket instead supercharges the existing vial within so that it inflicts double the normal fire damage a vial of alchemist's fire would normally inflict. An explosion pocket can be removed as a full-round action, allowing it to be placed on a different piece of clothing as the owner wishes.

                    <target><![CDATA[Suishen is a +2 defending flaming katana (see page 27). The ancestral blade of the Amatatsu family, Suishen is believed to contain the soul of the first Amatatsu emperor of Minkai. It has been passed down through generations of the family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually Suishen's idea to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line. Suishen can detect any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature marked by the Amatatsu Seal). Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner. Suishen has a number of additional abilities as well, though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself honorable and worthy of bearing the family's heirloom blade. Each time Suishen's wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms (such as Kimandatsu) is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order. If a new person wields Suishen, that person must learn the sword's additional powers all over again. • Resist energy (cold) 3/day becomes protection from energy (cold) at will. • Suishen gains the flaming burst ability. • Invisibility purge at will. • Suishen gains the bane ability against creatures with the oni subtype.]]></target>

If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity). When carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the banner of the ancient kings- once he releases his firm grip on the banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect. If the banner's carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 286), the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability.]]></target>

Up to three times per day as a standard action, you can use a harp of storms to surround yourself with an aura of brisk wind that grants you a 20% miss chance against all ranged attacks. This wind cloak effect lasts for 1 minute. At any time during that minute, you may strike additional notes on the harp of storms in order to produce one of the following three effects. • Air Walk: You cause the winds to lift you off the ground, granting you the effects of an air walk spell for 1 round. This is normally a move action, but if you succeed at a DC 15 Perform (strings) check, it is a swift action. • Gust of Wind: You can direct the winds surrounding you to duplicate the effects of a gust of wind spell. This is a standard action. • Lightning Strike: As a standard action, make a Perform (strings) check. You cause a bolt of lightning to strike a single foe within 30 feet, dealing an amount of electricity damage equal to the result of your Perform (strings) check. The target gets a DC 15 Reflex save to halve the damage caused by this lightning strike.]]></target>

's double-sided blade is folded blue steel, intricately engraved with ancient runes that light up with electric flame in the presence of dragonkind. The hilt is inlaid with ebony and wrapped with silver wire; the pommel features two silvered dragon heads. This weapon is a +3 wounding dragon bane greatsword. When the blade scores a critical hit on a dragon, the dragon heads on its pommel spit boiling acid into the wound hewn by the blade. This deals an additional 1d10 points of acid damage and 1d10 points of fire damage to the dragon.

The possessing creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be driven out of the body of the creature it is possessing. By expending 3 charges, the wielder can attempt to destroy a single undead creature with a successful hit. The creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be utterly destroyed. Spell resistance does not apply against either the banishing or destruction effect. Each ring holds 1 charge; when a charge is expended, one ring stops glowing.

In addition, a caravan equipped with a sashimono of comfort gains a +2 bonus on Security checks to resist the effects of severe weather. These effects function at temperatures between -50° and 140° F. If conditions are beyond these extremes, creatures using a sashimono of comfort treat the ambient temperature as if it were 50° F warmer or cooler respectively, thereby possibly allowing additional castings of endure elements to work normally.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The original Book of the Damned was collected from the scattered records of the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to record the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers of perpetually frozen and compressed ashes that seem to suck away ambient light into their material. All known copies of the text appear to be some variety of palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown when and by whom this redaction took place. In each case, the edited portions describe specific names relating to the earliest history of the plane, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is related to the same magic utilized by the Horsemen to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not neutral evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward neutral evil. Written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other mid-sentence, the text requires true fluency in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to "speak" to him, inserting telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature may "read" the text without actually opening the book merely by holding it and concentrating. A reader who splashes his own blood onto the book (which is promptly absorbed) and spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the spells on pages 38-39 and those listed below. The user gains at +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks when using the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Any energy-draining spell cast by the bearer bestows +1 additional negative level on affected creatures. The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if he were two caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures. Four times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, energy drain, death knell, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 39). It is believed that the bearer can be scried at any time, without a saving throw, by the Four Horsemen or their elite agents.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Molded from a pale, milky green wax into the shape of a column of screaming souls, and stamped on the bottom with the unholy symbol of one of the Four Horsemen, the candle of Abaddon is a boon to evil spellcasters, but also to any who would summon or interact with daemons. When burned, the candle sheds eerie illumination in a radius of 15 feet, similar to Abaddon's perpetual eclipse. A spellcaster within the radius of the burning candle gains a +2 bonus to caster level when casting spells with the evil descriptor. The light also acts as a magic circle against evil, but only against daemons. Within the light, all creatures take 1 point of damage per round, natural healing doesn't work, and magical healing requires a DC 24 caster level check to succeed. A candle normally burns for 4 hours, and any burning consumes at least 1 minute of its power. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties.]]></target>

It feels lighter than it should, as if hollow and partially filled with liquid. When the stone is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a hydrodaemon appears as if summoned by a summon monster spell.

However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell randomly. Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself. The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power. Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is. Chance of Page Condition Turning Caster employing a spell usable 10% by own class and level Caster employing a spell not usable 20% by own class and level Nonspellcaster employing divine spell 25% Nonspellcaster employing arcane spell 30% Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A deck of many things (both beneficial and malign) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat. Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone- if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.]]></target>

This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period. The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness 2 feet in diameter. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character. A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30. If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest. See also talisman of the sphere.]]></target>

A talisman of the sphere is worse than useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose). If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.]]></target>

Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The powers of the are as follows: astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind. Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use. d% Catastrophe 01-25 Natural Fury: An earthquake spell centered on the reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an intensified storm of vengeance spell is centered and targeted on the reader. 26-50 Fiendish Vengeance: A gate opens and 1d3+1 balors, pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders step through and attempt to destroy the owner of the Codex. 51-75 Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader's soul is captured (as trap the soul; no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body is entombed beneath the earth (as imprisonment). 76-100 Death: The reader utters a wail of the banshee and then is subject to a destruction spell.

Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb.

All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age.

The daikyu of commanding presence is a +2 seeking composite longbow that adjusts its strength rating to match the Strength bonus of its wielder. Once per day, the wielder of the daikyu of commanding presence can fire a single arrow into the air, which illuminates the surrounding area with the effects of a daylight spell for 1d6 rounds. All allies within the daylight spell's area of increased illumination (120 feet) receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge, for the duration of the daylight effect. If the wielder of the daikyu of commanding presence is a cavalier or samurai, this daylight effect counts as a banner for the purpose of the character's banner ability, and the morale bonuses are treated as for a cavalier or samurai of five levels higher. In addition, a cavalier or samurai wielding the daikyu of commanding presence can use his challenge ability against a foe within the first range increment of the bow, and deals extra damage to the target of his challenge with arrows fired from the bow. The daikyu of commanding presence is an ancestral weapon of the Higashiyama family, one of the five imperial families of Minkai. The daikyu is imbued with royal honor, and bestows one permanent negative level on any creature without honor who attempts to wield it (such as oni, traitors, kinslayers, and the like). The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.]]></target>

The confusion effect lasts for 8 rounds, and a DC 16 Will save negates the effect. In addition, in the round following a successful disarm attack with the dragonmaw nunchaku, the wielder can spin the nunchaku as a standard action, creating a curtain of whirling force replicas of the disarmed weapon around himself for 1 round. This functions as a ringed blade barrier with a radius of 10 feet around the wielder (Reflex DC 19). The disarmed weapon determines the damage dice of the blade barrier (i.e., 12d6 for a wakizashi, 12d8 for a katana, and so on). The disarmed weapon is unaffected, and drops to the ground as normal.

However, when the effect ends, the drinker's head immediately returns to normal. If the head is not within 5 feet of its body when the elixir's duration expires, the creature is slain immediately. The drinker knows when the elixir's effects will end 1 minute before they do so (no earlier). If the drinker's body is harmed or destroyed while its head is elsewhere, it takes that damage as soon as it reunites with its body, or is slain if its body has been destroyed. Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of remove curse. The drinker's body is considered helpless while the head is unattached.]]></target>

The chest has no lock, but any standard lock can be easily attached to its hasp. The interior of a captain's locker functions similarly to a type IV bag of holding, and can hold up to 2,500 pounds or a volume of 250 cubic feet. The chest's weight remains the same, regardless of what it is holding. A captain's locker does not rot or take any other damage from immersion in water and is watertight, even if opened underwater. When a captain's locker is placed within the hold of a ship or some other enclosed cargo-carrying vehicle (such as a freight wagon with a cargo box), the chest warps the dimensions of the cargo hold so that the area's cargo capacity increases by 50% without changing the weight of the vehicle. The cargo area remains attached to the vehicle, however, so outside conditions that affect the vehicle can also affect the cargo hold. If the captain's locker is removed from the cargo area while the hold contains more cargo than it could contain on its own, any excess cargo is forcibly expelled through hatches or other means of egress, dealing 3d6 points of damage to anyone standing within 5 feet of the means of egress.]]></target>

This attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round as its flesh calcifies. A DC 16 Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is permanently petrified, transformed into inert, mindless coral. Break enchantment or restoration reverses all of the effects of this calcification. This ability can be used up to 7 times per day.]]></target>

These bonuses and benefits don't stack with bonuses or benefits of the same type or from the same source. For example, a character with both Weapon Focus (bayonet) and Weapon Focus (heavy crossbow) would only gain the benefits of one of those feats when attacking with a sharpshooter's blade attached to a heavy crossbow. Use-activated abilities of the ranged weapon can be triggered through the sharpshooter's blade but count toward the usage limitations of the ranged weapon.

The detailed markings on these charts grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Profession (sailor) or Survival checks to navigate within the Shackles. In addition, a multitude of wrinkles, stains, and blemishes mar the charts' surfaces. Anyone meticulously studying the charts notices that these markings shift over time. The creases, smudges, and blotches on the map represent real weather conditions (such as clouds, rain, and wind) in the region, allowing an informed observer to determine the current weather patterns over the islands of the Shackles. The charts grant a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks made to predict future weather conditions and a +2 competence bonus on Survival checks to gain a bonus on Fortitude saves against severe weather. Finally, the pilot of a wind-propelled ship can make a DC 20 Profession (sailor) check to plot a course within the Shackles using the charts. If the check is successful, the charts grant the ship a +10% enhancement bonus to its waterborne speed as long as it follows the plotted course. All of the charts' benefits only apply within the geographic region of the Shackles.

Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. s can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie. Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced desecrate spell.]]></target>

The recipes can aid the reader in creating such dishes, allowing him to use the Profession (cook) skill untrained, or granting a +4 competence bonus on such checks if the reader is trained in that skill. Furthermore, once per day, this book can be used to enhance a meal the reader is cooking. When used in this way, it grants the meal being cooked the effects of a heroes' feast spell (caster level 11th).]]></target>

A halfling who puffs on the pipe as a full-round action can shape the smoke into an object weighing no more than 5 pounds and having a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot. The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects created by solidsmoke pipeweed last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor. Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct. Each pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking. A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed, so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic feet. A halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create a key that would open that particular lock. This smoke is caustic and chokes non-halflings. It grants non-halflings no benefits, and each time they spend a standard action to smoke the pipeweed, they are sickened for 1 round.]]></target>

The lantern's light causes the illumination level in a 30- foot radius to move one step toward dim light, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from darkness to dim light. The lantern has no effect in an area that is already in dim light. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in the lantern's area. Magical light or darkness only change the light level in the lantern's area if they have a higher caster level than the lantern. Once per day, the lit lantern of dancing shadows can be commanded to create quasi-real illusions from the shadows cast by its light, as the shadow conjuration spell. In addition, once per day, the lantern can be commanded to solidify shadows for a short period of time. These solidified shadows cause incorporeal creatures within the lantern's illumination radius (30 feet) to coalesce into semi-physical forms, as the mass ghostbane dirge spell (Advanced Player's Guide 225).]]></target>

Upon command, it transforms into a black raven (use the stats for an eagle) or a giant black raven (use the stats for a giant eagle). Both forms of the raven have Improved Steal (Advanced Player's Guide) as a bonus feat. The raven understands Common but cannot speak. It can answer questions related to its abilities or what it has seen by cawing once for "yes" and twice for "no." The raven can maintain its non-figurine status for only 24 hours per week. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments. After three transformations into its giant raven form (though not its smaller version), the statuette loses all magical properties.]]></target>

When taken aboard an undamaged sailing vessel at sea, the model automatically reconfigures to become a perfect replica of the new ship. It takes 24 hours for the model to attune to the ship. A ship attuned to an impossible bottle takes half damage from all attacks that deal damage. The model ship in the impossible bottle absorbs the remaining damage, registering holes in its hull, rips in its sails, and scorch marks from fire. Once the attuned ship gains the broken condition, however, the impossible bottle ceases its protection, and any further attacks on the attuned ship deal full damage. If the attuned ship gains the sinking condition or is destroyed, the impossible bottle shatters and is permanently destroyed. If an impossible bottle was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship has been fully repaired, the impossible bottle re-attunes itself over 24 hours and thereafter resumes its protection. An impossible bottle removed from its attuned ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back on board. If the bottle is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the impossible bottle is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage. Lastly, an impossible bottle can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as the bottle still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by smashing the impossible bottle against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel.]]></target>

When attached to a ship by a rope or chain and dropped into the water, the anchor increases its weight to properly anchor the ship it is attached to. Once per day, the skeleton anchor can hold the ship it is attached to immobile for up to 1 day, or until commanded to release. The greatest property of a skeleton anchor, however, is to summon undead skeletons from the corpses of drowned mariners, who rise from the depths of the sea and clamber up the sides of the ship to serve as its crew. The undead created by the anchor are 1 Hit Die skeletons (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 250) that possess Profession (sailor) scores of +7. Each skeleton can perform the duties of one crew member but has no other abilities. The skeletons cannot speak, attack, or even defend themselves. They are not proficient with any weapons or armor. The skeletons obey the commands of the ship's captain or pilot, but they only obey orders pertaining to the operation of a ship. A skeleton anchor can be used just once every 7 days to create up to 28 skeletal crew members. The skeletons do not count against the maximum total Hit Dice worth of undead creatures that the user can control. The skeletons act as crew for 1 week or until dismissed by the ship's captain or pilot. At the end of the week, the skeletons abandon the ship.]]></target>

In addition to being a notorious pirate captain, Tevenida Aiger was a priestess of Norgorber, and her specialty was the capture of Chelish warships, particularly those employing devils or other extraplanar defenses. Some whisper that Captain Aiger and her sword vanished in the Black Tower due to a Chelish trap set in the structure, but in fact her fate was much grimmer than that (see Part Three of "The Price of Infamy" for details). is a short sword of the planes (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 477). Three times per day, it can be used to cast dimensional anchor on a creature the sword has just struck- activating this effect is a swift action for the sword's wielder. If the strike is a critical hit, the effect gains a +10 bonus on its caster level check to penetrate the target's spell resistance, if any. The weapon's greatest power, though, is its ability to destroy portals or seal planar rifts. Once per year, can be plunged into an extraplanar portal as a standard action-doing so immediately results in two effects. First, it targets the portal with a mage's disjunction (this effect lasts for as long as the sword remains in the portal). Second, as long as the sword remains lodged in the portal, it becomes affected by an antipathy effect against all outsiders. Once removed from a portal, it takes the sword a year to build up its magic to be able to use this ability again.]]></target>

Creatures within a 10-foot radius of the target point are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful DC 13 Will save means a creature is dazzled for 1 minute instead. Sightless creatures, or those without line of sight to the target point, are unaffected. The second ability causes a bolt fired from the crossbow to function as a screaming bolt (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 475).]]></target>

Although a wizard hook does not allow for fine manipulation, it is infused with magic that bolsters somatic components-you can use a hand stump outfitted with a wizard hook to fulfill any somatic components for casting arcane spells. A wizard hook also grants proficiency in its use as a weapon. You can make touch attacks with spells using a wizard hook, either by making a normal attack with the hook (in which case it deals normal hook hand damage plus the spell effect), or by making a touch attack with the hook (in which case you gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll and the save DC of the spell increases by +1, but you do not do hook hand damage).]]></target>

Although made of gold, Chellan functions as an adamantine weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. Chellan is a +5 keen scimitar, and its density allows it to damage foes as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. It can be properly wielded only by characters with a Strength of 18 or higher-all other characters must either wield it as a two-handed weapon or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with the weapon. Whenever Chellan strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slowed as per the spell slow (CL 16th). If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be turned into a crystalline statue, as if by flesh to stone. Characters turned to crystal by Chellan appear to be made of ruby, diamond, or some other valuable gem, but are in fact merely colored quartz of little value to looters. Fanatical in the extreme, Chellan seeks to force its wielder into serving Karzoug and furthering the runelord's goals. To enforce this purpose of their existence, it can use its intelligence and special abilities to aid and manipulate those who think to wield it.]]></target>

The pistol shows signs of wear and exposure to the elements, but its walnut stock, nickel-plated barrel, and gold accents are of fine craftsmanship, and its mechanisms still move with precision. Ammunition fired from an enervating pistol deals an extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical hit, an enervating pistol bestows a negative level on its target. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or they become permanent. An enervating pistol bestows one permanent negative level on any creature wielding it that is not undead or does not possess an undead hand. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.]]></target>

Three times per day, a sirocco cannon can be commanded to create a special type of ammunition. This ammunition functions as a normal cannonball, but on a successful hit, a gust of furnace-hot wind blasts downward in a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder around the target or target square for 10 rounds. This hot wind deals 4d6+10 points of fire damage to all creatures in the area and knocks them prone. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save halves the fire damage and avoids being knocked prone. Flying creatures forced into the ground by the powerful downdraft take damage as if they fell unless they make a DC 15 Fly check, in which case they remain at their original altitude. Any creature that takes damage from the hot air becomes fatigued (or exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a previous round of exposure). Creatures with the water subtype take a -4 penalty on all saving throws against this effect and take double normal damage. This special ammunition deals no additional damage to ships or structures.]]></target>

The humor to be extracted can be adjusted as needed, and must be immediately poured into a potion vial or the extracted humor is lost. Extracting a humor takes a variable number of rounds-as soon as the victim has taken a total of 6 points of damage in all from the bleed effect, the extraction is complete. For 24 hours after extraction, this purified humor has an additional effect, functioning as one of four potions as listed below (all function at caster level 3rd).

                    <target><![CDATA[A paradox box resembles a small stone chest of ornate design that measures approximately 1-1/2 feet by 1-1/2 feet by 1 foot. Closer inspection reveals the paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box-it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box-most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many Thassilonian creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words. These items are prize finds for organizations such as the Pathfinder Society, because a particularly clever investigator can often still open them, revealing their time-lost secrets even though the command word might have been lost millennia ago.]]></target>

When using the anathema archive t o c ast s pells, t he u ser can either simply open it (in which case it randomly opens to one of the new Thassilonian spells presented earlier in this chapter) or the user can attempt to force the anathema archive to open to a specific spell from that list or to any arcane spell she knows how to cast. Doing so requires a Spellcraft check (DC = 20 + double spell level)-failure indicates the archive opens to a random spell from this chapter's seven earlier options. Whatever spell the anathema archive i s o pened t o, t he u ser may cast that spell from the scroll as if she were casting a spell from a normal scroll, save that the spell is not consumed from the anathema archive upon being cast. When used for research, the anathema archive g rants a +10 insight bonus into any one Knowledge check associated with sinister or frightening ancient topics (subject to the GM's discretion-sample subjects include evil outsiders, runelords, Thassilon, Leng, evil religions, or undead). This allows a character to make the Knowledge skill check untrained. Each time a character uses the anathema archive, her mind becomes increasingly haunted and unhinged. Upon using the archive, the user must make a Will save (DC = 15 + twice the total number of times the user has used the anathema archive). Failure results in the user taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain and becoming confused for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the total number of times she has used the artifact. The anathema archive closes automatically each time it is used, and cannot be opened again for 24 hours by any force.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This 12-foot-high, 10-foot-diameter cauldron is made of solid iron, cast in one piece and thick enough to withstand great heat. Its side is marked with the Sihedron Rune, while many other Thassilonian runes grace its rim. A runeslave cauldron has the ability to infuse the body of a freshly slain giant, reviving it and transforming it into a runeslave (see page 412). Before it can be used, the runeslave cauldron must first be activated by filling it with a specially prepared broth of rare necromantic ingredients and rainwater collected from several open graves. The cost of the special ingredients is 10,000 gp, but once the cauldron is filled, a fire lights under it automatically and keeps the broth bubbling and functional for 1 year. Once the cauldron is filled with broth, one need only sacrifice a giant (the method of killing the giant is incidental) and then place the giant's corpse wholly or partially within the cauldron's bubbling contents. One hour later, the sacrificed giant rises from the cauldron as if true resurrection had been cast on it. In addition, the newly revived giant gains the runeslave template (see page 412). The cauldron can revive up to five giants a day in this manner. Non-giant corpses placed in the broth are unaffected by the cauldron's magic. Any living creature (save for a runeslave) completely immersed in the boiling broth inside a functional runeslave cauldron immediately takes 6d6 points of fire damage per round. In addition, the smoke produced by the cauldron as it boils is particularly noxious to good-aligned beings. It spreads to a radius of 30 feet around the cauldron, and while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision, its foul-smelling vapors sting and burn those of good alignment. Each round such a creature remains in the smoke, he must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded and nauseated for as long as he remains in the area plus an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving the area.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Runelord Alaznist, inspired by and jealous of Karzoug's success with the runewell of greed, experimented with variant runewells of her own design. Many of these minor runewells of wrath existed in her domain-though today most are lost deep under the waters of the Varisian Gulf or are hidden away in Hollow Mountain, with only the one remaining on mainland Avistan hidden in the Catacombs of Wrath under Sandpoint. Every time a creature with a wrathful soul (including most goblins and quite a few of the victims murdered years ago by Jervas Stoot) dies within a mile of a minor runewell, it gains 1 wrath point. There's no limit to the number of wrath points the minor runewell can store, but it currently contains only 20. Each time the well's waters are drawn upon (as detailed below), a number of wrath points are expended. If enough points are expended to put its total at 0 or negative wrath points, the minor runewell deactivates, its waters fading away. Reactivating the minor runewell requires long-lost rituals-or the reactivation of a major runewell somewhere else in the world. Such an event restores a minor runewell of wrath to a starting level of 3 wrath points. A minor runewell is only 3 feet deep, yet any living creature that enters its freezing orange waters immediately takes 2d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be overcome with wrath. Failure indicates the creature becomes enraged (as if under the effects of a rage spell) and immediately attacks the nearest living creature. If no living creatures are in sight, the enraged creature is compelled to seek out a victim, moving at full speed in its search. This rage persists for 2d6 minutes, after which point the creature becomes fatigued. Each activation of a minor runewell in this manner costs 3 wrath points. A minor runewell can also be commanded to disgorge a sinspawn. To manifest a sinspawn, a creature need only allow a few drops of its blood to fall into the pool. One round later, a sinspawn emerges from the well and immediately attacks the closest creature in which it cannot scent wrath. Each use of a minor runewell in this manner costs 6 wrath points.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Currently hidden at the heart of the Eye of Avarice in a demiplane lodged between Leng and the Material Plane, Karzoug's runewell of greed is the key to both his escape from the destruction of Thassilon and his eventual return to life. The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path, but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's escape. Beyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian, Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the Sihedron take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a Sihedron medallion (see p age 426). H e can also, given time, call up from the runewell a live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell rather than called. Karzoug can only have one such dragon in existence at any one time, and must wait 8 hours after a previous dragon's death before calling a new blue dragon to serve him. The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. The liquid it contains functions in all ways as molten gold-dealing damage is if it were lava upon creatures splashed or immersed within it. Gold drawn from the runewell cools normally and is permanent-the runewell immediately replenishes gold taken from its supplies-yet this gold cannot exist more than 30 feet from the runewell's rim. If brought beyond this range, it vanishes in an instant. Runewells associated with other runelords and sins exist throughout the ruins of Thassilon; each of these artifacts is a unique item with its own powers.]]></target>

Created originally by a special sect of wizards who served under Runelord Sorshen, sadist's lashes swiftly became quite popular throughout Thassilon.

Additionally, any creature that takes damage from a sadist's lash takes a -5 penalty on Will saves against all enchantment effects created by the wielder of the lash for 1 minute unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Will save.]]></target>

This does not significantly damage the soul (although it does cause it a severe amount of spiritual anguish)-a creature that dies and has its soul filtered through the soul lens can still be brought back to life as normal.]]></target>

As a standard action, the wielder may transform the club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's damage does not change but the type of damage changes to one of the following to suit the shape of the club: bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting (piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as Weapon Focus (bite) or the bloody claws spell (Advanced Player's Guide). If the wielder has the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wildshape to increase the weapon's damage by one step (Core Rulebook 145) for the duration of that wild shape as long as the druid remains in contact with the weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always increased in this fashion. If unattended, the club reverts to its normal shape.]]></target>

If the target escapes the grapple or the wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle). The wielder can also let go of the chain's handle while grappling or pinning the target; if he does so, the chain remains in place and the target gains the entangled condition (Escape Artist DC 20 to slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain's handle as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a swift action, which releases the bound creature.

Whenever the wielder of a blade of the rising sun threatens a critical threat (regardless of whether the critical is confirmed or whether the target is subject to critical hits), the target is surrounded by a halo of golden sunlight equivalent to faerie fire until the beginning of the wielder's next turn. Undead surrounded by this glow take 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turn. The wielder of a blade of the rising sun may declare a sacrificial strike (similar to the retributive strike of a staff of power) as a standard action, or as an immediate action before losing consciousness upon gaining the dying or dead condition. A sacrificial strike converts the wielder's body and spirit into raw energy equivalent to a sunburst (DC 22). Allies of the wielder within the sunburst are not harmed, and the wielder may choose to affect all allies within the sunburst as mass cure light wounds or all allies within 10 feet as breath of life. The caster level for the effects of the sacrificial strike is equal to the sword's caster level plus 1/2 the wielder's level (maximum 25th level). A sacrificial strike destroys the wielder's body (as the spell disintegrate), but she has a 50% chance of being reincarnated (as the reincarnate spell) 24 hours after performing a sacrificial strike in a random safe location within 1 mile. The wielder's gear is left behind unharmed after the sacrificial strike; however, the blade of the rising sun is teleported to a random location at least 100 miles distant.]]></target>

For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a -4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks for that round.]]></target>

In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2). The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60- foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This finely crafted +2 nine-ring broadsword has an extra gap at the base of the blade's unsharpened edge, closest to the hilt, seemingly to fit an extra ring. The wielder of a ten-ring sword can use a full-round action to place a magic ring into the empty slot, where the ring then rests until removed (another full-round action). Once a ring is fitted to the tenth slot, the sword's wielder can employ that ring as if he were wearing it, even if he is currently wearing two magic rings. Alternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material. In the event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to the sword's tenth slot, the sword's wielder decides which of the weapon's two properties will be in effect when the ring is placed. However, the sword's wielder can use a move action to switch between properties.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This rod absorbs spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character holding the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time. A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know. A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy. To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: on a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.]]></target>

If the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creatures within 120 feet that intend to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of any unfriendly creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing any 11 (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground.

For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges. Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire or a magic fire of size Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those generated by a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell. When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod. If a rod of flame extinguishing is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges. A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found.

                    <target><![CDATA[This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. In addition, it has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds. The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day. • Use hold person upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed at a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost. • Use Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action. • Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person. The following functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. • In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace. • When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon stretches to an overall length of 4 feet. • When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth from the ball, and the whole weapon lengthens to 4 feet. • When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or a +3 longspear. A spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice) for an overall length ranging from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance. The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. • When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the climbing pole by pushing button 5. • The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12. • When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.]]></target>

There the rod's possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time-up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. All fractions are rounded down. In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are abundant. The climate is comfortable for all creatures present. Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If an unwilling creature succeeds at its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod. When the rod's effect expires, is dismissed, or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod's possessor can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week.]]></target>

Once per day, the rod garbs her in magically created clothing of the finest fabrics, and adorns her with furs and jewels. Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part of it, use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her. The value of the noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6 1,000 gp)-1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewels (maximum of 20 gems; maximum value 200 gp each). In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent-a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as 100 people. The tent and its trappings last for 1 day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.]]></target>

Its other powers are as follows. • Lightning: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod fails to score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still apply. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round. • Lightning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt dealing 9 d6 points o f electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet. • Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this sonic power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round. • Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds). • Thunder and Lightning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap power with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke power. The thunderclap affects all creatures within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This ornate scepter of bronze and mithral has a flanged head like a golden-white sunburst. A scepter of heaven acts as a +1 evil outsider bane morningstar. The scepter has the following powers when wielded by a good-aligned creature. • The wielder of a scepter of heaven gains a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks made to dispel magic against with the evil descriptor or effects created by evil outsiders. • The wielder can use the scepter to use bless weapon on command and at will as the spell. • Once per day on command, if the wielder can shoot a spear of purity (Ultimate Magic) from the scepter. If the wielder of a scepter of heaven wears a crown of heaven, the scepter's caster level increases to 15th (increasing its aura to strong) and, when used as a weapon, it gains the holy property. A good-aligned wielder may also use holy smite, holy sword, and holy word, as the spells, once per day each. A scepter of heaven is of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the rod is in hand and disappears when the rod is no longer held. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the rod is being held.]]></target>

The wielder of this scepter gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge (nobility) and Diplomacy checks. Furthermore, once per day, and on command, the wielder can affect up to seven living creatures with good hope, as the spell. If the wielder of a suzerain scepter has the Leadership feat, she may attract double the normal number of followers for her Leadership score; however, if the rod is out of the wielder's possession for more than 1 week these extra followers leave. In addition, a suzerain scepter radiates a continuous bless effect that affects any cohort, follower, animal companion, familiar, special mount, or creature charmed or summoned by the wielder (but not called creatures or those under dominate or other compulsion effects). Whenever the wielder creates an effect that provides a morale bonus to such creatures (not including the scepter's bless effect), that bonus increases by 1.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This sturdy iron rod is forged with pronounced angles to allow for strong gripping, inscribed with images and sayings of trickster figures from myths and common folklore. Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such. In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command. Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.]]></target>

Each dragon staff is linked to one type of chromatic dragon: black, blue, green, red, or white. All the spells that can be cast using the staff are tied to that choice. If the wielder uses the staff to cast form of the dragon II, she must assume the type linked to the staff. Any energy types chosen by spells from the staff must match the type as well (black and green are linked to acid, blue is linked to electricity, red is linked to fire, and white is linked to cold). The staff allows use of the following spells: • Fly (1 charge) • Protection from energy (1 charge) • Dragon's breath (2 charges; Advanced Player's Guide) • Form of the dragon II (4 charges) In addition to these powers, the wielder of the dragon staff also receives a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC and the ability to make a bite attack as a primary natural weapon. This bite deals 1d8 points of damage if the wielder is Medium. These bonuses are a polymorph effect and are replaced by those gained from casting form of the dragon II, or other similar spells.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A staff of power is a potent magic item with varied offensive and defensive abilities, carved from magically hardened wood. It is usually topped with a glistening gem or orb that burns from within with a flickering red light. The staff allows the use of the following spells: • Continual flame (1 charge) • Fireball (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Levitate (1 charge) • Lightning bolt (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Magic missile (1 charge) • Ray of enfeeblement (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Cone of cold (2 charges) • Globe of invulnerability (2 charges) • Hold monster (2 charges) • Wall of force (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only, 2 charges) The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (a free action), the staff deals double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round. A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 x the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 x the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01-50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.]]></target>

The staff is crafted from platinum and topped with a glowing blue diamond. The staff allows the use of the following spells: • Bless (1 charge) • Cure moderate wounds (1 charge) • Freedom of movement (1 charge) • Hold person (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Prayer (1 charge) • Searing light (1 charge) • Cure critical wounds (2 charges) • Flame strike (2 charges) • Righteous might (2 charges) • True seeing (2 charges) The wielder of a staff of the hierophant gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a +2/+2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff deals double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round. A staff of the hierophant can be used to restore the life of a dead creature by calling upon the wielder's deity to take the staff as a blessing. This causes the staff to vanish, but restores life to any one dead creature as if casting true resurrection. In addition, after using this effect, the wielder who triggered it receives a +2 luck bonus on all ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 day.]]></target>

This consumes a number of charges equal to the number of spell levels increased by the feat. No more than one feat can be applied to a spell cast by the wielder in this way.

In addition to 1d4+4 nonmagical charms, each bracelet carries one of each of the following magic charms. These magic charms can be activated with a command, producing the listed effect, but each charm can be only used once. After a charm is used, it dissolves into a thick vapor and dissipates. Arming Sword: When detached, this charm transforms into a masterwork heavy wooden shield and a masterwork longsword. They can either appear on the ground or within the hands of the creature that activated the charm, ready to use. These items last for 1 hour before turning into vapor. Healthy Apple: When detached, this charm becomes an apple that when eaten (a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity) heals 2d8 hit points. In addition, if the creature eating the apple is afflicted with any poison or diseases, it can attempt a new saving throw against each such affliction. Each successful saving throw immediately ends the corresponding affliction. Loving Heart: Upon detaching this charm, the wearer can use charm person as a spell-like ability (as the spell, Will DC 11) any time before the end of her next turn. Lucky Star: When this charm is activated, it releases good luck in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the wearer. The wearer and her allies within the burst gain a +2 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. Peaceful Dove: Detaching this dove calms tempers within a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the wearer as though calm emotions (Will DC 13) had been cast. A creature affected by rage takes a -2 penalty on this saving throw. Reduce the price of a charm bracelet that has one or more expended charms by 1,580 gp per absent charm. The charm bracelet itself becomes a nonmagical bracelet worth 100 gp when the last charm is used, no matter the number of nonmagical charms left on the bracelet.]]></target>

The bracelet grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks, and a +5 resistance bonus on Will saves against enchantment effects. If the wearer makes a successful Will save against an enchantment, the caster of that spell incorrectly senses the effect has succeeded. Additionally, the bracelet's wearer knows an enchantment targeted him and the enchantment's source. Seducer's bane creates an aura on its wearer, visible to detect magic, matching the failed enchantment spell or effect, and lasting as long as the intended enchantment's duration.

                    <target><![CDATA[Consisting of a vine with five green berries, a verdant vine is worn tied around the wrist. Once per day on command, the wearer can pinch a berry off the vine, and throw it up to 30 feet away, like a splash weapon. Viciously thorny vines erupt in a 20-foot radius from the point of impact, even if the berry misses its target. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or become entangled, as the spell entangle, as the vines coil around the creature's legs. The vines persist, but at the start of the affected creature's turn, it gains a new saving throw against the effect. If the affected creature fails the saving throw, it also takes 1d4 points of damage. A DC 20 Strength check, made as a standard action, allows an affected creature to break free and end the effect. Failing the check causes the vines to constrict, dealing 1d4 points of damage.]]></target>

These creatures can continue to make ranged or magical attacks over the line. Any other creature may disturb the line simply by scuffing it.

By dabbing the doll with a few drops of blood from a living creature (a standard action), the bearer can form a sympathetic link between the doll and the victim. If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the doll must beat the target's spell resistance to create the link. As a standard action, the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the sickened condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative energy damage plus 1 point for each die of the doll bearer's sneak attack damage (if any). Each time the target is affected by the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link. The doll's holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight. Once linked to a particular creature, an anatomy doll cannot be linked to another creature, but the bearer can re-establish a broken link by anointing it with more of the target's blood.]]></target>

Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. Once thrown, a bead of force functions like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses the targeted creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.]]></target>

These brands demonstrate a bond of friendship and balance, not ownership and subservience. Applying the brand requires a full-round action each for master and companion. The brand enhances the share spells ability of druids, wizards, and other classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing these characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the marked companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character has line of effect to the creature. Each spell cast at range in this way drains one charge from the beast-bond brand for each spell level of the spell cast. A newly applied beast-bond brand has 10 charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes. For the purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master may treat a marked companion as an object or a creature, whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still apply). A character may have only one creature marked in this way at any time. The brand lasts until all charges are expended or the master marks another companion in this way.]]></target>

When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature's life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the black soul shard absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The black soul shard can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned black soul shard is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death. Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again. A creature can only have one black soul shard attuned to it at a time.]]></target>

Filling the reservoir takes a full minute, deals 4 points of Constitution damage (which can be healed normally), and imbues the reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the reservoir changes the blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with time. The wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or more charges from the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability score damage per charge used. The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue herself with a great burst of physical prowess, depleting all remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus to one physical ability score equal to twice the number of charges used. This bonus lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn. The bearer can only use the reservoir if it is held in hand or attached to a held or wielded weapon. A bearer can safely carry only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highest-charged reservoir intact. A reservoir has no effect if not charged with the wearer's blood, and cannot be charged by bloodless creatures or those that cannot take Constitution damage.]]></target>

The creature's flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate. The bearer of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the flesh to the animate skeleton, which ends the necromantic magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse of a person killed or mutilated by knife wounds).

Any creature can use this syrup as a dose of injury poison (including the 5% chance to affect the user if she does not possess the poison use class feature). Any creature struck by a weapon coated in this syrup must save against the hex (DC 15) or be affected as if the witch had targeted them with the hex directly. The syrup counts as a poison and is a magical effect. If the hex cannot affect a target more than once every 24 hours, subsequent doses of the syrup are similarly ineffective against that target. Once imbued with the power of a hex, the syrup lasts for 24 hours before reverting into useless, harmless liquid.]]></target>

Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual if the candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame. A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties. In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process.]]></target>

Once per day as an immediate action, a creature brandishing a cape of bravado may attempt to compel an opponent within 30 feet to attack him on its next turn (Will negates DC 11).]]></target>

When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.]]></target>

The bearer may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime again, ending its silence early and unleashing the shout in a direction of his choosing. If dropped while vibrating, the chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases the shout effect in a random direction.

Typically, each of the cube's faces are polished smooth, but sometimes they are etched with runes. The device enables its possessor to put up a special cube made up of 6 individual wall of force spells, 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges when fully charged-charges used are automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the following table. When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage to a wall drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. The charge cost to maintain each of the cube's six walls is summarized below. CUBE CHARGE CostMAX. FACE PER MINUTE SPEED EFFECT 1 1 30 ft. Keeps out gases, wind, etc. 2 2 20 ft. Keeps out nonliving matter 3 3 15 ft. Keeps out living matter 4 4 10 ft. Keeps out magic 5 6 10 ft. Keeps out all things 6 0 As normal Deactivates Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also drain extra charges. These spells cannot be cast into or out of the cube.

If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side.

It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.

In addition, the powerful force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage per round to a creature that is subjected to it. The geyser can only affect one target per round, but the user can direct the beam of water without needing to make an attack role to strike the target since the geyser's constant flow allows for ample opportunity to aim.

When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table.

To activate its powers, the user it must be unstopper the jar as a standard action while thinking deeply about a specific person or object that she has seen at least once from up to 30 feet away. When then poured onto the ground, the syrup flows at 15 feet per round following the most direct route to the creature or object visualized, provided the creature or object is on the same plane, leaving behind a sticky trail. The syrup can flow uphill or even up stairs and can pass through openings as narrow as one-sixteenth of an inch. It cannot penetrate other liquids or porous or absorbent surfaces (such as sand or sawdust).]]></target>

A fully charged horn has 3 charges-charges used are automatically renewed each day. So long as the horn has at least one charge remaining, it's owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking from the horn to gain the following benefits: 1 charge: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points (as if from an aid spell), which last for 1 minute. 2 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is enlarged, as the spell enlarge person, for 5 minutes. 3 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is enlarged for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a heroism spell for as long as she is enlarged. A creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive its full benefit. Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a potion-it takes a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action required). To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full round drinking from the horn, which always provokes and attack of opportunity. To use all 3 charges, the drinker must spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn.]]></target>

The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem. The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons.

Once per day, the talisman can impart this animosity to a ranger (or other character with the favored enemy class feature), replacing one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated creature type. This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).]]></target>

Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm.

If consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion's or extract's formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the normal fashion. Using the alembic does not harm the potion, but the process makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally). The alembic can only distill the knowledge of formulas on the alchemist extract list (for example, it cannot turn a potion of a cleric-only spell into something an alchemist can learn).]]></target>

Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts. One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination. Another command word causes the gem of brightness to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge. The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges. A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.]]></target>

When a goblin skull bomb breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new goblin skull bomb. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new goblin skull bomb. A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull. It can be safely moved using spells (such as mage hand or telekinesis) or attacked with ranged weapons (hardness 0, 1 hp).]]></target>

A newly created pouch of grave salt holds 5 doses. Grave salt can also be used directly against restless spirits. A single dose can be hurled up to 15 feet as a ranged touch attack.

While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains.

The exact size and specific parameters (such the composition of timber) are chosen when the spike is placed. Interacting with the illusion grants a Will save (DC 12) to disbelieve it. Hammering the spike into place or removing it is a full-round action. The spike can be used any number of times and its effects last until removed.]]></target>

While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, +8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC. Touching the key and speaking the command word causes the key to disintegrate, leaving the lock intact and rendering the mechanism operable again.]]></target>

Once per day, the bearer may touch the leaves to her tongue to assume tree shape (as the spell) for up to 8 hours, appearing as a healthy tree that is lush with thousands of autumn leaves for the duration of the effect. While in tree form, a creature may release these leaves upon the wind, consciously controlling them as a scrying sensor with the abilities of arcane eye. The leaves have the statistics of an army ant swarm, except the swarm has plant traits, fast healing 5, and vulnerability to fire. The creature may shape the scrying leaves into a semblance of her face, allowing her to speak through the leaves. The leaves' voice is a quiet, dry rustle, and they are capable of conveying most of the creature's intended facial expressions (they can smile, frown, and so on). If the creature has the wild empathy class ability or is a sorcerer with the fey bloodline, she may have any ghost sound, speak with animals, or speak with plants spell she casts originate from the leaves instead of herself, and her tree shape does not prevent her from casting these spells. If the scrying leaves fail to return before creature returns to its normal shape, the magic item does not function for 1 week. During this time, the leaves fade to brown and appear to have a light coating of frost on them.]]></target>

When the locker is unsealed and opened, the migrus-a desiccated hairless cat with a humanoid face-is found within. After a few moments the migrus animates and begins to clean itself, and its face begins to take the appearance of the creature who opened the migrus locker. The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master. The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body. The migrus has attributes of a cat familiar (Bestiary 131) except it has the construct type. The migrus always does its best to return to its master and cannot be permanently destroyed by normal means. If the locker is destroyed (hardness 5, 10 hp), the migrus is destroyed, no matter the distance to the locker.]]></target>

When a creature holding the mirror is targeted by an attack, he can spend an immediate action to summon his reflection from the glass to interpose itself between him and the blow. The reflection functions as an image produced by the spell mirror image. If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result. If the attack does not strike the image, the image fades away at the start of the mirror bearer's next turn. The mirror can be used three times per day.]]></target>

The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack). When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner. If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.]]></target>

A creature who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows. • Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the creature controlling the mirror is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language. • View other places as if with clairvoyance, and the controller can even view locations on other planes if she is sufficiently familiar with them. • Use it as a portal to visit other places. The controller first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror. • Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell).]]></target>

Once affixed, the scale causes the creature to take on the attributes of a particular type of naga, chosen when the scale was created. Her skin becomes scaly, her eyes slitted and reptilian, her tongue forked, and her neck lengthens and distends until it resembles a cobra's hood. The creature gains a +4 bonus to her natural armor, darkvision 60 feet, and a poisonous bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small creature)Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect varies by the scale's naga type (see below); cure 1 save. Each scale also grants its wearer access to a special ability, as follows: Dark naga: The wearer gains a +8 bonus on saves made to resist any form of mind reading and a +2 bonus against charm effects. Poison effect: sleep for 1 round. Guardian naga: The wearer can spit venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make saves to avoid the poison's effect. Poison effect: 1d2 Con damage. Spirit naga: Once per minute, the wearer can attempt to charm a single creature within 30 feet, as the spell charm person (Will DC 19 negates). Poison effect: 1d4 Con damage. Lunar naga: Once per day, the wearer can spend a standard action to fascinate all creatures within 30 feet, as per the spell hypnotism (Will DC 19 negates). Poison effect: 1d3 Con and 1 Wis. Royal naga: Once per day, the wearer can attempt to blind or deafen a single creature within 30 feet, as the spell blindness/ deafness (Will DC 19 negates). Poison effect: 1d6 bleed. Water naga: The wearer gains a swim speed equal to its base land speed, and can breathe water or air. Poison effect: 1 Con. The bindi's effects last for 11 minutes, or until the creature spends a standard action to return to her normal form. The bindi can be used twice before it loses its luster and becomes nonmagical.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight, resulting in a portable extradimensional space. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains, traveling with the item. The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process.]]></target>

Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent. The price and creation cost given are per ounce.]]></target>

Once ingested, the gut-stone remains active for up to a week, maneuvering itself within the body to protect its bearer's vital organs. Any time an attack would subject the bearer to precision-based damage (such as a critical hit or sneak attack), that damage is instead directed to the gut-stone. All other damage from the triggering attack, as well as damage that surpasses the gut-stone's hit points, is applied to the character normally. A gut-stone has 10 hit points and hardness 0. When a gut-stone is damaged by a melee weapon attack, as a free action its owner may sacrifice the stone to damage the attacker's weapon. Treat this as the bearer making a free sunder combat maneuver against the weapon, except that it does not provoke an attack of opportunity, bypasses the weapon's hardness, and deals 1d4 points of damage. Only one gut-stone may be in a creature's body at a time. Any attempt to swallow a second destroys both stones and forces the creature to make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. If a gut-stone is not used within a week of being swallowed or is destroyed it crumbles apart and is passed harmlessly out of the body.]]></target>

If there is no such stone available (for example, if there is only sand, earth, worked stone, or smaller pieces of stone), the stone conjures a Large earth elemental as if using summon monster V. The stone cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.]]></target>

Once removed, the nail leaves no hole or other sign of its presence. The nail can support 500 pounds. If used to hold a door shut, increase the break DC of the door by +2.

When used as a focus as part of a summoning spell of 3rd level or less, it creates a faintly-glowing intangible magical chain from the caster to the summoned creature or creatures. The duration of that summoning spell is extended as if using the Extend Spell feat, with no increase in casting time. The chain prevents the creature from moving more than 30 feet from the caster, even when using teleportation (though the caster can use these effects to exceed this distance, which ends the shackling effect immediately). The chain does not otherwise obstruct or interfere with any object or creature other than the summoned creature. The shackle may be used up to five times per day. If the shackle or the chain is dispelled, the range limitation and increased duration ends; if the spell's unmodified duration would already have ended by then, the spell ends immediately.]]></target>

The creature does not get a saving throw to resist, though spell resistance still applies. If successful, the caster possesses the creatures' body until the duration of the summoning spell ends, at which time his mind returns to his body, the creature's mind returns to its body, and the creature disappears.]]></target>

It can be folded, twisted, hinged, and bent, to form almost any known tool. Hammers, shovels, even a block and tackle (without rope) are possible. It can duplicate any tool the wielder can clearly visualize that contains only limited moving parts, such as a pair of scissors, but not a handloom. It cannot be used to replace missing or broken parts of machines or vehicles unless a mundane tool would have done the job just as well. The any-tool counts as a set of masterwork artisan's tools for most Craft or Profession skills (although very specialist crafts such as alchemy still require their own unique toolset). It is an ineffective weapon, always counting as an improvised weapon and never granting any masterwork bonus on attack rolls.]]></target>

The padlock side is used to lock and alarm doors, chests, and other portals. The bearer may speak a command word to activate it when holding it against a lockable item. If the padlock side of the seal is touching the item, it bestows an alarm (mental alarm) and arcane lock on the target item. If the lightning bolt side of the seal is touching the item, it casts fire trap on the lock (the seal must be held to the lock for 10 minutes to use this ability). A creature carrying the seal can speak a command word to suspend its effects on an item for 1 minute. This ability is usable at will, but only works on effects created by that specific seal. The seal can be used at will but can only maintain effects on three items at any given time. Using it on a fourth item automatically negates the oldest effect.]]></target>

If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly.

As a full-round action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle. The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell. If the spell does not ordinarily allow a save, creatures caught in the splash radius may still make a Will save to negate it (with the +5 bonus).]]></target>

When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. For example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful and good powers, but a neutral cleric gains access to no powers. All of these are command-word activated. Chaotic (violet flame): Word of chaos once per day on command. Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of protection from evil and heroism. Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of protection from good and may use harm twice per day. Lawful (golden flame): Dictum once per day on command.]]></target>

However, a bearer not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she makes use of its powers. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell randomly. Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through the book is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. Once per day, the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as if from a scroll, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound permanently within the book itself. The owner of the book need not have the book in her possession in order to use its power. The book can be stored elsewhere and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power, so long as no other creature attempts to make use of the book, in so doing becoming its owner. Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is. CHANCE OF CONDITION PAGE TURNING Caster employing a spell usable 10% by own class and level Caster employing a spell not usable 20% by own class and level Nonspellcaster employing divine spell 25% Nonspellcaster employing arcane spell 30% Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A deck of many things is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat. Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone-if others help, dread wraiths appear to fight them as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards. PLAQUE TAROT CARD PLAYING CARD SUMMARY OF EFFECT Balance XI.

                    <target><![CDATA[At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the knucklebone's true power and nature becomes apparent. When a creature holding the knucklebone of fickle fortune looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see the table). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction. d20 RUNE NAME EFFECT 1 Eya-Doh The character gains 1 permanent negative level. 2 Bvu The character is subject to a powerful compulsion never to roll the knucklebone of fickle fortune again. He can shake this compulsion only by succeeding a DC 25 Will saving throw. He can attempt this saving throw only once per day. 3 Eij The character is affected by a harm spell (caster level 15th). 4 Hor The character is subject to a powerful compulsion to roll the knucklebone three more times immediately (Will DC 25 negates). All three of these rolls are made with a -5 penalty on the knucklebone's die roll (minimum 1). 5 Veh The character is blinded as with blindness/deafness (no saving throw). 6 Chu The character takes 5d10 points of cold damage (DC 25 Fort save for half) and moves at half speed for the next hour (a successful saving throw does not negate the reduced speed). 7 Roh For the next 24 hours, the character suffers a -2 penalty on all skill and ability checks. 8 Seh The character is paralyzed for 2d12 hours, as with hold monster, except he cannot attempt new saving throws to overcome the effect. 9 Kog For the next week, the character emits a horrible smell. He suffers a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Stealth checks. 10 Vis Once, during the next 24 hours, the character can reroll a single die roll he has just made and take the second result, as if using the good fortune ability from the Luck domain. 11 Fyeh The character gains 100 points of fire immunity, as if using protection from energy. 12 Xal The character gains the benefits of a heroism spell for the next 200 minutes. 13 Yaq For the next 24 hours, when the character hits a target he is flanking with a melee weapon, the attack does +1d6 points of precision damage. 14 Gib Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast faerie fire (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the knucklebone of fickle fortune before the 24 hours is concluded. 15 Xku The character is immune to fear for the next 24 hours. 16 Lev Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast a lightning bolt (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the knucklebone of fickle fortune before the 24 hours is concluded. 17 Nhi For the next 7 days, when the character is the target of healing magic, he heals an additional 2d8 hit points. This effect is lost if the character rolls the knucklebone of fickle fortune again before the 7 days are concluded. 18 Zmi For the next 24 hours, whenever the character succeeds on a saving throw against a harmful effect that does half damage or partial effect on a failed save, the knucklebone's character takes no damage or suffers no effect. 19 Tem For the next 24 hours, the character automatically confirms all critical hits. 20 Eha-Zah The next time the character dies, he comes back from the dead the very next morning as if the subject of a resurrection spell. This effect is negated if the character rolls the knucklebone of fickle fortune again before he dies.]]></target>

It can only be parted from its bearer when all three of its wishes are used or it is destroyed-but such a feat takes time and patience. When a bearer uses a wish granted by the monkey's paw, he is then subject to a curse, as per the spell major curse (DC 25 to remove; Ultimate Magic 215). This curse manifests as the creature taking a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks until the curse is removed. These penalties are cumulative in cases where multiple wishes are used before past curses are removed. Once all three wishes are used, the monkey paw plane shifts to a random plane and begins the process anew.]]></target>

This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period. The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.]]></target>

Its boards are splintered and it is branded with a number of angular runes, each said to bind the soul of a sailor to the vessel. Due to its powerful magic, it is seaworthy and very fast (though it doesn't offer its passengers much in the way of comfort). It needs no crew. Creatures that spend a week on the boat (which is usually discovered drifting aimlessly at sea) find that they can control the boat by just speaking the name of a port or a description of a specific destination that can be reached by way of the sea the runescarred dragonship is currently sailing. The runescarred dragonship then sets sail toward that destination. It always takes the safest path, navigationally speaking, to the spoken destination. If there is more than one creature capable of giving the boat commands, the runescarred dragonship gives each order equal weight, changing its course each time a new command is given. A runescarred dragonship can carry 5 tons of cargo or 120 Medium creatures. It moves at a rate of 10 miles per hour.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness 2 feet in diameter. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character. A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30. If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest. See also talisman of the sphere.]]></target>

Unlike a normal staff, a staff of the magi holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. A staff of the magi does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers do not use charges: • Detect magic • Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates) • Hold portal • Light • Mage armor • Mage hand The following powers drain 1 charge per usage: • Dispel magic • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half) • Ice storm • Invisibility • Knock • Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half) • Passwall • Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates) • Wall of fire • Web These powers drain 2 charges per usage: • Monster summoning IX • Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates) • Telekinesis (400 lbs. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates) A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)]]></target>

Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a talisman of reluctant wishes must make a DC 15 Charisma check. If the check fails, the talisman acts as a stone of weight (see page 351). Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish i s m ade w ith i t, whichever comes first. It then disappears. If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like. The artifact grants one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.) Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.]]></target>

A talisman of the sphere is worse than useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose). If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he needs to check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.]]></target>

The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a wizard of tremendous power and wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle for all time. The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its inhabitants still bound. A would-be wielder of the Bottle of the Bound must know three secret commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can be removed; the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment, to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use the bottle like a summon monster IX spell at will, except only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial summoned creatures' destruction or return. No known force can open the bottle without the Word of Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word of Binding, its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level creatures and moving on to higher-level ones, until they all escape. If one of the Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of Banishment being uttered, it is free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The Words to use the Bottle of the Bound have been lost for uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least one or two of them.]]></target>

The Brazen Egg's inside has enough room to transport no more than eight Medium creatures, two Large creatures, or one Huge creature (as long as the Huge creature is squeezing). The egg has two methods in which it can move itself. The first is by a method similar to the dimension door spell, but the egg and all creatures within the egg are teleported. The second method is similar to the plane shift spell, though the egg can move to any plane it desires (it needs no focus) and when the egg plane shifts so do all creatures currently within it. The egg has its own quirky, unabashed personality and can telepathically communicate with all creatures inside it or within 100 feet, regardless of language. The Brazen Egg's chief goal is to disrupt that plans of Hell's archdevils, but it requires the help of other creatures to do so. It often trades its ability to teleport and plane shift in order to gain such aid, but in dire circumstances it has the ability to enchant creatures in order to achieve its goals-and when it is close to reaching its goals it has little compunction in doing so. Once per day, the egg can affect a single creature within it as per the spell dominate person (though it is not limited to humanoids and can affect any living creature). Additionally up to three times per day it can affect creatures within it as per the spell mass charm monster.]]></target>

Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The celestial lens was c reated to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars. Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing light focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning. Only divine intervention or powerful magic like wish or miracle can overcome this limited range, making a new person or place the center of the lens's orbit.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of-or unable to tap into-its fantastic power. This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities. • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability. • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower. • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet). • Wind wall at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The Codex is enormous-supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a destruction spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind. Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The Codex of the Infinite Planes has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use. d% CATASTROPHE 01-25 Natural Fury: An earthquake spell centered on the reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an intensified storm of vengeance spell is centered and targeted on the reader. 26-50 Fiendish Vengeance: A gate opens and 1d3+1 balors, pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders step through and attempt to destroy the owner of the Codex. 51-75 Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader's soul is captured (as trap the soul; no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body is entombed beneath the earth (as imprisonment). 76-100 Death: The reader utters a wail of the banshee and then is subject to a destruction spell. This repeats every round for 10 rounds until the reader is dead.]]></target>

Ironically, the rapier was claimed by a powerful Nidalese vampire named Volsazni Dezarr as a trophy after he single-handedly slew the entire cabal during their foolish attempt to destroy him. Since then, Volsazni has bequeathed the weapon as a token of his favor to no fewer than a dozen vampiric thralls and five of his dhampir children-Gnaeus being the latest of these recipients. As long as is carried, the user gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against negative energy and level drain, and whenever he makes a Fortitude save to recover from a negative level, he may roll the save twice, taking the better of the two results as the actual result. Once per day, can target an undead creature it just successfully critically hit with a halt undead effect (Will DC 14 negates) as a swift action.]]></target>

When it is held in both hands and its command word is spoken, a pulsing light throbs at the core of the sphere and the sound of an ongoing exhalation of breath emanates from the orb. This effect lasts for as long as the user concentrates, up to a maximum of 6 rounds per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the orb that possess an Intelligence of 3 or higher (save the orb's user, who is immune to its effects as long as it is held) must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to approach the sphere and touch it-this save is required every round the creature remains within 10 feet of the user and the orb. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. The first applicable creature to touch an active orb of consumption takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (a successful DC 15 Will save negates this damage). The life energy and sanity consumed by the orb grant the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 1 hour per point of Constitution or Wisdom damage dealt. Additional uses do not increase the bonus to Charisma but do increase the duration of the effect.]]></target>

One application is enough to plug both of a creature's ears-applying the wax is a standard action. Once applied, the wax imparts a -2 penalty on Perception checks, but imparts a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against charm or language-dependant compulsion effects, like charm monster, command, and suggestion. If placed in the ears of a willing or helpless creature currently under a charm or language-dependant compulsion effect, the dose immediately allows the creature to make a new saving throw against the original effect to throw off the charm or compulsion effect (although without the normal +4 bonus granted by the wax if used when a creature is first targeted by such an effect). A single dose of wax of defiance lasts for 1 hour once applied.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This ancient gold coin measures an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch thick. One face bears one of the seven Thassilonian runes for magic and sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column. When carried, a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem to be in Thassilonian, but which are never loud enough to understand. These whispers are only slightly distracting, and in fact offer a boon to the carrier of the coin- they grant a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the school of magic associated with the coin's rune (the coin found in this adventure bears the rune of lust, and thus grants a +1 resistance bonus against enchantment spells). Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in Thassilonian while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either "yes" (the Thassilonian rune) or "no" (the broken column); the word "yes" or "no" is also whispered into the user's ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture. You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not "Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?" The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not-if the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a "yes" or "no" into the user's ear. The coin's one use for the day is still consumed.]]></target>

The bracers are normally forearm guards made in the style of masterwork padded or quilted cloth armor. They are often made of silk or high-quality linen, though they can also be crafted of leather or even chain links. A command word is normally inscribed on the inside of one of the bracers. The sack can be used to store a single suit of armor, including a shield. The armor retains its normal weight when stored. If items other than a suit of armor and a shield are put in the sack, they immediately fall through. Three times per day, the wearer of the bracers can speak the panoply's command word to have the suit of armor and shield stored in the sack teleport onto the wearer. The sack must be within 500 feet of the wearer of the bracers in order to function. If the wearer is already in a suit of armor, it is teleported into the sack at the same time the new armor is teleported onto the user's body. As long as the armor to be worn is the same size as the user, it fits perfectly and doesn't interfere with anything else worn or hindering the user, including any grapple or tight space the wearer might be trapped in.]]></target>

Once per minute, the weapon's wielder can use heal on herself by striking a living and nonmagical tree with Blackaxe, causing the tree to wither to ash. The artifact is inexorably tied to the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who can call Blackaxe to his hand as a free action, despite any intervening distance, so long as Blackaxe is not kept in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. While Blackaxe is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location and condition (as via the discern location and status spells), and by concentrating can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses. While in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link, treating Blackaxe as if it were the source of the spell-like ability. Each time Treerazer does so, Blackaxe's wielder must make a successful DC 25 Will save to avoid being staggered for 1 round from the flow of power. These spell-like abilities trigger during the wielder's turn in initiative, but do not consume any of the wielder's actions in that round.]]></target>

Any creature of good alignment that willingly touches the tome must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be immediately slain. Additionally, while the Book of the Damned is outside of its repository (see below), any evil being of demigod-level power (daemonic harbingers, demon lords, infernal dukes) or greater using scry or a similar spell can view the Book of the Damned with no risk of being detected by the bearer. Finally, any creatures that make use of any of the tome's abilities are damned, condemned to one of the Lower Planes after death regardless of their deeds. Only the intervention of a deity can prevent this punishment. The complete compilation of the Book of the Damned can be used in multiple ways-as a profane talisman, as an obscene reference volume, and as a gate to the multiverse's most complete repository of unholy lore. Talisman: As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all spells with the evil descriptor as if she were two caster levels higher and gains a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks made when interacting with evil outsiders. The bearer can also make use of the following spell-like abilities: At will-align weapon (evil only), bestow curse, detect evil, speak with dead 3/day-banishment, blasphemy, dictum, magic circle, unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight, word of chaos 1/day-dimensional lock, gate, greater planar binding, soul bind Reference: Any character who can read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal and who spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily contiguously) studying the tome learns soul-tainting secrets- the ultimate blasphemies of all creation. The bearer gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a question. Additionally, the book's descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that any teleportation to or within those planes always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). The bearer of the Book of the Damned also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with evil outsiders). Once per day, the bearer can ask the tome a question relating to any profane topic; she then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if the bearer had cast vision. The book also contains a copy of every spell with the evil spell descriptor. Repository: Once per day, the bearer of the Book of the Damned can cause the tome to disappear into its own internal demiplane, leaving behind a sinister shimmering portal. This reproduces the effects of a mage's magnificent mansion spell, allowing the bearer and those she chooses to enter an unnerving but semi-safe library filled with the countless volumes of blasphemous records the Book of the Damned merely serves as a window upon. The book and those within the repository are affected by a powerful nondetection effect, shielding all within from the sight of even the gods. Creatures do not age while inside, although upon leaving, they immediately age an amount equal to the time spent inside. While within the demiplane, visitors may access any of the powers described in the Reference section. Creatures of nonevil alignment find the macabre surroundings and frightening servants within the repository unsettling, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be afflicted as if by the nightmare spell every time they attempt to rest within. Nothing can prevent this effect. The entrance to the Book of the Damned's repository can be entered by creatures other than those the bearer chooses on certain nights, specifically during lunar eclipses and the midnight hour on the night of a new moon, during which time the barely visible portal manifests as a normal door.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Approximately 15 feet tall and 15 feet square, this crude hut rises atop a pair of gigantic chicken legs that, when not tucked beneath the structure at rest, endlessly pick and scratch at the hut's surroundings. The lifelike legs aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, though. The small building's only door opens into a room more than twice the size of what the structure could naturally contain, but this remarkable space is but a threshold to places more wondrous still, for it is merely one possible configuration of countless extradimensional rooms (see page 23 for a map of this "default" layout of the hut's interior). Nothing that transpires outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories, the defensive and the transportive. Defensive: At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct. The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed on the following pages. A creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death-and disappears an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but nothing complicated that requires it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or seek a specific place. Transportive: As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to countless-if not infinite-locations across the planes. To use these transportive abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients inside, and stir the everbubbling stew within-a process requiring a full-round action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients act as "keys" to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel to has a specific combination, or "recipe," of two keys, which appear to be relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later. Once the proper keys have been placed in the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide). The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination-the keys are tied to that specific location at the destination. Once at a destination, the Dancing Hut can move (or be moved) to any other location on that world or plane normally. Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut. Each time a new combination of keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout of the hut changes, as each location the hut can travel to has its own corresponding layout of the hut's interior. The map on page 23 depicts a sample layout for the hut's interior, but as the hut travels, this layout can change dramatically, though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls, regardless of how many rooms are present in that layout. When the hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, and are inaccessible from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (and perhaps some other residents of the hut as well) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the hut, regardless of the hut's physical location. The table above presents a list of some of the best-known destinations the hut can travel to, along with the two keys needed to take the hut to that location. This list is by no means all-inclusive, and none-save perhaps Baba Yaga herself-know the limits of the hut's transportive properties.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A Harrow Deck of Many Things is usually found wrapped in cloth or velvet and hidden away within a simple wooden case, but nothing marks it as being anything other than an oft-used and treasured focus of the Varisian fortune-telling art. As soon as one of the deck's cards is drawn at random, though, its nature becomes apparent and an effect determined by the chosen card is bestowed upon the user-often to life-altering effect. A bearer of a Harrow Deck of Many Things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards he will draw before doing so. These cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw any more cards from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number or is somehow prevented from doing so, the cards flip out of the deck on their own after 1 hour. Future attempts to draw cards from the deck made by someone who has already drawn his allotted number reveal only blank cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced, making it possible to draw the same card twice. A Harrow Deck of Many Things contains 54 cards, with the effects of each detailed in the following Effects of the Harrow section.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[At its most basic level, the Lens of Galundari functions as the focal point for an inward-facing magic circle spell of the user's choice. The magic circle varies in radius, but can hold one outsider called into its space by the spell planar binding, regardless of its size. While the lens improves the effectiveness of the spell planar binding, it does not actually cast the spell, requiring some outside agency to cast the spell while employing the lens as an additional focus component. The target of the planar binding receives its normal Will save to resist, but once it appears within the lens's magic circle, it cannot escape-the lens prevents the outsider from using its spell resistance or Charisma to escape, and locks it in place as per the spell dimensional anchor. Once trapped within the lens's magic circle, an outsider is trapped indefinitely, until it agrees to the user's demands or a sentient creature touches the prison with intent to free the outsider-doing so releases the outsider immediately. Even rolls of 1 on Charisma checks to coerce the outsider into service do not free the outsider. While the lens does not grant the user a bonus on Charisma checks made to influence creatures trapped within its prison, it does grant the user an additional use for the outsider: The outsider can be bound within the lens, transforming the artifact into an arcane engine of sorts. The user must compel the outsider to submit to this service, as described by the spell planar binding. The outsider receives a +10 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to resist entering into service. This bonus is reduced by 1 for every week the outsider remains bound (minimum 0). The lens can only hold one outsider at a time, and it cannot employ its magic circle effect while an outsider is trapped within. If an outsider agrees to be bound into the lens, it becomes trapped inside the lens and cannot free itself. While bearing the lens, the wielder can employ any of the outsider's spell-like abilities. How often the wielder can use these spell-like abilities is limited by the outsider's Hit Dice and the frequency with which the imprisoned outsider can normally use its spell-like abilities. The outsider's Hit Dice become a pool of soul points the wielder has access to, with each Hit Die equating to 1 soul point. The lens's bearer can employ the imprisoned outsider's spell-like abilities by spending a number of soul points equal to the spell-like ability's spell level. If the lens no longer has enough soul points to pay for a spell-like ability's use, the ability cannot be used. If the imprisoned outsider can only use a spell-like ability a certain number of times in an amount of time, the wielder cannot employ that spell-like ability more than that number of times in the amount of time specified, even if the lens has enough soul points to pay for the ability's use. The lens's total number of soul points replenishes every day. The outsider within the lens can be freed by spending 1 soul point. The released outsider is exhausted, but is not controlled by the lens's bearer. The outsider within the lens can also communicate telepathically with a creature touching the artifact, though it exerts no control over the bearer.]]></target>

This bonus decreases by -1 every day until the orb returns to its normal DC or is again steeped in a dragon's blood.

                    <target><![CDATA[The Scepter of Ages can be wielded as a +4 heavy mace with a critical threat range of 18-20. In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner might have their physical ability scores reduced; consult Table 7-2 on page 169 of the Core Rulebook for the effects of aging on common humanoids. For the wide range of unlisted humanoids and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply on a race-by-race basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by -1 for every 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders, and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these abilities might not be immediately usable). The spell regenerate restores 1 year of premature aging for every hit point it heals. Creatures killed by aging can only be restored by true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells do not heal aging, returning the target to life only 1 year younger than his maximum age. In addition to its use as a weapon, the Scepter of Ages can open a portal through time. To do this, the scepter's bearer must spend 10 minutes precisely aligning the delicate mechanisms within the artifact's head to the exact dates she wishes to travel to. This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to a general period. The bearer can rush through calibrating the scepter, activating it in 1 minute, but doing so increases the associated DCs by +10. Regardless of whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect. What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the Accidental Time Travel Results table on page 43). The time beyond the portal cannot be viewed and can only be discovered by passing completely through. The rift remains open for 1 minute before closing. What creatures or conditions lie beyond the portal are determined by the GM (see the Ages of Golarion table on page 43 for examples of different times on Golarion).]]></target>

To open the gate, one must unfurl the scroll and speak the names Aliskiren, Isles of Night, Ismaizade, Kakishon, Khandelwal, Khosravi, and Serpent Isles, each time touching the section of the rune corresponding to the named island group. Once, this process allowed the user to choose where to appear within the realm, but the scroll is now damaged, and upon activation, all creatures within 50 feet with line of effect to the scroll must make a DC 40 Reflex save. Those who fail are sucked into the scroll and bodily transported to one of the waypoints within the demiplane of Kakishon (see map). At the same instant creatures enter the plane, any being that previously entered the plane involuntarily may choose to depart, being expelled from the scroll back to the Material Plane. Once inside Kakishon, escape can prove difficult, requiring those trapped within to wait for others to enter, for the casting of a spell similar to plane shift, or for the discovery of one of the foundations of Kakishon's reality, all of which transport the subjects back to the Material Plane to a point within 10 feet of the Scroll of Kakishon.]]></target>

Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from their prayers, granted by the skull regardless of its location or ownership. There is no way a mortal can block this effect. Possession of the skull grants several abilities. Blessing of Scales: All reptilian creatures (including worshipers of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids wild-shaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the Skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10. Unholy Aura: The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the Skull of Ydersius as the point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (bane and dimensional anchor). Voice of the Serpent: Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make a successful DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to a feeblemind spell. Any good-aligned creature that carries the Skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.]]></target>

This weapon is a +3 keen speed sword, with the type of sword varying from wielder to wielder. Upon being taken up by a new owner, the weapon transforms into any type of sword of the wielder's choosing, mundane or exotic. From that point on, the weapon always transforms into that type of sword whenever it is held by that individual. While bearing Vesper's Rapier, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks made to influence humanoids, and can use the rapier like a compass to point in the direction of the closest collection of gems, silver, or drinkable water as a standard action at will. The sword also grants the wielder the ability to either slip or tighten the bonds of the physical world, granting her the ability to cast dimension door, dimensional lock, or greater teleport. These powers have limits, though, as they can drain the sword's magical abilities for the day-dimensional lock and greater teleport can be used once per day and drain the sword immediately after their use; dimension door can be used at will, but drains the sword after 3 uses, though the wielder can continue to use dimension door even if the sword is drained (this is the only effect that functions even when the sword is drained). If the sword becomes drained, it loses all of its magical properties (aside from dimension door), including its +3 enhancement bonus, skill bonuses, and the keen and speed special abilities.

                    <target><![CDATA[A bone house is a variant form of instant fortress most often employed by elite agents of Nidal and influential members of Zon-Kuthon's faith. These grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a clenched fist. When activated by speaking a command word, a bone house grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress-even knock spells can't open the door. The bone walls are magically enhanced to be as hard as stone, and have 100 hit points and hardness 10. A bone house can be repaired by casting inflict spells on the walls, with every 10 points of negative energy repairing 1 point of damage. A bone house springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone caught in the area takes 10d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage). The interior of a bone house is under the constant effects of a desecrate spell and is considered an altar to Zon-Kuthon for the purposes of determining the desecrate modifiers. Once a bone house is expanded into tower size, its owner can create up to four mummies per month from the drifts of bone ash and detritus that litter the inner rooms. Creating a mummy in this manner takes 10 minutes, and the owner must be inside of the bone house the entire time. Due to the desecrate effect, mummies created inside gain +2 hit points per Hit Die. These undead guard the contents of the bone house without needing to be commanded. If the owner wishes to command these mummies to perform other tasks, he must use other means to do so. No more than four mummies may be active at one time. A bone house is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The Hourglass of Shadows is a foul artifact that allows the user to process a creature's remains into an undead shadow. The unwieldy, 5-foot-tall device rests suspended on an iron stand fitted with pivots that allow its user to rotate a central chamber of etched, smoke-colored glass. To operate the device, the user must place the ashes of a Small, Medium, or Large sentient creature into the glass chamber along with a crushed onyx worth 100 gp. After the ashes have flowed through the chamber three times-a process that takes 3 hours-the contents can be emptied. If deposited into a clay pot filled with grave dirt and brackish water, the ashes transform the mundane container into a shadow urn. A creature whose remains have been defiled in this way cannot be restored to life by any method short of a miracle or wish until the shadow urn containing its spirit has been destroyed. A shadow urn contains an unquiet spirit befouled by the Hourglass of Shadows. These fragile urns can be thrown, have a range increment of 10 feet, and shatter on contact with any creature or solid surface. When a shadow urn is broken, the single greater shadow contained within is released. This shadow is free-willed-owing no allegiance to the owner of the Hourglass of Shadows or whoever broke its urn-and typically attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger for life energy. A shadow urn is destroyed when it is used. If not shattered, a shadow urn contains the soul within indefinitely.]]></target>

The silver-and-gold frame is equally elegant and etched with faintly glowing arcane symbols. The painting is a powerful minor artifact that can be used to create one or more duplicates of any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 10. By touching the painting and uttering a command word, the subject creature is drawn into the painting and appears seated in the chair. The subject is under the effects of a binding spell. Delving into the subconscious mind, the painting creates a duplicate of the subject that lasts for 1 day per Hit Die the creature possesses. If the subject creature has a positive Charisma modifier, additional duplicates equal to its Charisma modifier may be created. Each of these duplicates represents an alter ego of the subject. Some beings may have multiple alter egos. In this case, the subject creature determines exactly how many id duplicates he wants the id portrait to create, up to a maximum determined by his Charisma modifier. An id duplicate can be of a different class from the subject creature, and it has average hit points for that class, the same number of Hit Dice as the subject creature, and the same basic knowledge and goals as the subject creature (modified by any ability score changes). It is an average member of its class, with appropriate skills and feats. Reallocate the subject creature's ability scores to make them appropriate to the new class chosen. A duplicate can carry out whatever tasks the original creature desires. If all duplicates are destroyed, the original creature is ejected from the id portrait and permanently loses 1 point of Charisma (this cannot be replaced by any means short of a miracle or wish). In addition, he is under the effects of slow and dimensional anchor for the following 24 hours. These effects cannot be dispelled. The portrait is usually placed somewhere hidden and safe, or in the care of trusted guardians, since the subject creature is significantly weakened until he recovers from the magical effects. When a duplicate has lived out its allotted time, it simply dies. Even if the duplicate is slain or dies before its duration expires, the body remains and behaves as a normal corpse. Spells such as miracle, raise dead, and resurrection fail to affect a duplicate corpse created by the id portrait. An id duplicate has a challenge rating equal to the base creature's CR -1.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A maleficus spike is an ancient item forged of cold iron with an adamantine core designed to keep demons at bay. When driven into the wall of a building, a maleficus spike infuses the walls of the structure with a dimensional lock effect and a ward that repels evil outsiders. Any outsider with the evil subtype that tries to enter or damage the warded building must attempt a DC 30 Will save. If it fails, the outsider takes 12d6 points of damage and becomes nauseated for 1 hour. An outsider that remains inside a building warded in this manner must make a new Will save each round to avoid damage and nausea. The effect is lessened against non-outsider evil creatures, but they too are affected-such creatures gain a +4 bonus on their Will saves, take only 4d6 points of damage on a failed save, and are nauseated for only 1 minute. The stone and doors of a structure warded by a maleficus spike are considered to be magically treated (+20 to Break DCs, double hardness, and double hit points). Additionally, the structure self-repairs damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round, provided the damage was inflicted while the maleficus spike was functioning; the spike can't repair existing damage when it is installed. A maleficus spike consumes an enormous amount of magical energy. It contains enough energy to ward a structure for 24 hours, after which it becomes dormant until recharged. Recharging a maleficus spike requires a spellcaster to spend 10 minutes in contact with the spike, after which the spellcaster selects a number of spell slots totaling no fewer than 24 spell levels to expend to infuse the artifact with enough energy to ward the structure for another 24 hours. Prepared spells in these slots are lost for a day, and for spontaneous spellcasters those slots are used for a day. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to fuel a maleficus spike.]]></target>

For most, this means an excruciating, spell-blasted death; for a small fraction of others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed lich; but for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A phylactery of the failed has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magic-user's body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with a remnant of his shattered consciousness. The creature that opens a phylactery of the failed must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be affected by a disease-like curse known as a parasitic soul (detailed below). Those affected by a parasitic soul have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant ambitions and memories of the would-be lich whose destruction created the phylactery. If the cursed creature is killed by the parasitic soul, her body is animated 1 day later as a lich with the same memories and abilities of the magic-user who created the phylactery, essentially allowing that spellcaster to finally achieve lichdom. The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the lich is destroyed. If the parasitic soul is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The parasitic soul can only infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a parasitic soul, the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect other creatures. The invasive nature of phylacteries of the failed has spawned the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading death's head coffer (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #8). Parasitic Soul Curse and disease; save Will DC 30; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Intelligence damage; cure a parasitic soul can only be cured by casting both a spell that prevents the target from being mentally controlled (like protection from evil) and remove curse.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Dangerous artifacts created by the demon lord Angazhan, several totems of Angazhan lie hidden in the depths of the Mwangi Expanse. Each is an intelligent artifact largely in control of itself. A totem radiates an aura that forces all non-worshipers of Angazhan within 30 feet to make a successful DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A totem can also make use of its own spell-like abilities as it pleases, frequently lashing out with weird to attack. Its size and direct connection to Angazhan's power prevents it from easily being used by other creatures. Any who would employ its powers must touch the totem. Those who aren't chaotic evil worshipers of Angazhan must also enter into a contest of wills with the totem to make use of its powers for that day (see page 535 of the Core Rulebook). If a creature wins the contest, that creature can direct the totem to use its abilities. Additionally, the creature is immune to the totem's panic aura for 24 hours and the totem cannot use its spell-like abilities against the creature for that day. Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a chaotic evil charau-ka (The Inner Sea World Guide). A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a chaotic evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor rules as the Gorilla King for another year. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to chaotic evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King). If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.]]></target>

Any nonevil creature who touches the Fork of the Forgotten One is given a choice: become lawful evil immediately, or die. Those who choose death are instantly slain (Fortitude DC 30 negates). Those who choose to become lawful evil change alignment immediately (no saving throw) and are subject to a demand spell (Will DC 25) requiring that they find the Forgotten One and free him from his icy prison-presumably thereafter he will press them into service for his plans of revenge against those who imprisoned him.]]></target>

When one of these teeth is swallowed, it grants the user the following powers for 1 full week or until it is dismissed as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. • The user is immediately polymorphed into a dragon, as if subject to form of the dragon I, II, or III, depending on the user's Hit Dice. If the creature swallowing the tooth has 12 HD or fewer, it is affected as per form of the dragon I. Those with 13 to 18 HD are affected as per form of the dragon II, and those 19 or more Hit Dice are affected as per form of the dragon III. The type of dragon is chosen by the user based on its alignment. Lawful good: bronze dragon, gold dragon, or silver dragon Neutral good: any metallic dragon Chaotic good: brass dragon or copper dragon Lawful neutral: any chromatic or metallic dragon Neutral: any chromatic or metallic dragon Chaotic neutral: any chromatic or metallic dragon Lawful evil: blue dragon or green dragon Neutral evil: any chromatic dragon Chaotic evil: black dragon, red dragon, or white dragon The user's draconic appearance is always the same each subsequent time it swallows a tooth. While in draconic form, the user gains the following benefits. • The user is able to speak Draconic • The user gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks. • The user gains a +4 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks made against or involving dragons. • The user is immune to sleep and paralysis and gains a spell resistance equal to 11 + its Hit Dice. • The user gains frightful presence (Bestiary 300) with a 200-foot-radius range and a Will save DC equal to 10 + Hit Dice + Charisma modifier. The jar never creates dragon teeth for the same creature more than once. If the owner changes before all the teeth created by the jar are consumed, the original owner no longer gains benefit from this artifact.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Each of these fabled Orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an Orb can, as a standard action, dominate a dragon of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon-but only the breath weapon-of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day. All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th. • Black Dragon Orb: Fly. • Blue Dragon Orb: Haste. • Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport. • Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying (Will DC 18 negates). • Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates). • Gold Dragon Orb: The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs-including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity-but can use an individual power only once per day. She can dominate any other possessor of an Orb within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates). • Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand. • Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire. • Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds (Will DC 18 half). • White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold) (Fortitude DC 17 negates).]]></target>

However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The Shadowstaff also has these powers. • Summon Shadows: Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level. • Summon Nightshade: Once per month, the staff can summon an advanced shadow demon that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level. • Shadow Form: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by gaseous form. • Shadow Bolt: Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.]]></target>

In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid). A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the Shield of the Sun.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to "swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending appendage and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag has a CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free. The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.]]></target>

The window melds ever so slightly into the surface, allowing it to ignore minor protrusions, curves, or anything else that would normally make it difficult to simply lay down a pane of glass. On command, the front of this glass displays all activities on the other side of this surface like a window, piercing wood, earth, or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal. The window does not reveal its existence to non-hostile creatures depicted within it, allowing observers to study them at their leisure. However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window presents its owner and anyone looking through the window with an artificial image of the other side designed to lull them into a sense of false confidence- enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While presenting this image to those in front of the mirror, it reveals those viewers to the enemies being observed, creating a two-way window; however, viewed creatures see those using the mirror accurately and can read their thoughts as if using detect thoughts. Furthermore, the image shown to those using the mirror does not reveal that the creatures they are watching can see them as well. Once the curse activates, the owner comes to regard using the mirror to spy ahead as his most effective tactic (after all, it has no limit to its duration) and does so whenever possible until curse-breaking magic frees him from its influence. Anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles, even if he wasn't the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to this desire to continue using it.]]></target>

This flame persists inside of her for the next 24 hours, causing minor discomfort and giving her the sickened condition, but causing no visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a flammable object or structure, she feels inclined to set the object ablaze, using any means at her disposal. Each round the wielder resists this urge, she takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within her surges and roils. After 1 minute of this, she must make a DC 15 Will save or succumb to the temptation; if she saves, the urge passes, the internal fire stops harming her, and she can interact normally with the flammable target thereafter. Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid using the item to try and extinguish or suppress any fire she encounters which she herself did not start. She cannot use the rod against fires that she personally started.

Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it mysteriously refers to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction. Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring, along with the following additional powers. • As a standard action, Chomper's possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any single creature or unattended item within a 5-foot radius. Chomper (not the wielder) can then make a single bite attack against the target. This bite has a +14 attack bonus and deals 1d10+5 points of damage plus 2 points of bleed damage. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities. • When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If Chomper manages to gain dominance over a non-demon wielder through a personality conflict, it directs its bearer to seek out victims to feed to it.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power. The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object-though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a metamagician's apprentice, he or she can still wield one. The rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it transforms into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form. A metamagician's apprentice knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as Silent Spell and Empower Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell. The rod can use read magic and detect magic at will. The metamagician's apprentice is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the explosive runes spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills. A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist. If a metamagician's apprentice becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.]]></target>

To attach this jar's leeches, the user merely needs to open the jar and upend the contents over his head and torso as a standard action-the leeches do the rest, attaching to the user's body almost instantaneously. These leeches impart a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, but also a -4 penalty on Diplomacy checks against creatures that might find such a practice grotesque (such as most civilized races). Once applied, the leeches persist for 8 hours before they die. The leeches are immediately destroyed if the wearer takes more than 20 points of damage from any area-effect energy damage. The jar automatically refills with a new batch of fortifying leeches after 24 hours. While the fortifying leeches are applied, a bloatmage immediately regains 2 bonus points to her blood pool-this cannot increase her blood points to higher than her normal maximum. In addition, whenever the bloatmage uses her bloat ability to gain extra blood points, she may roll her bloat dice twice and take the more favorable result.]]></target>

When pressed against an inanimate surface (such as a wall or article of clothing), the eyeball absorbs into it, leaving a magical sensor of the same size on the surface. Anyone holding an eye from a particular cluster of spy eyes can share the view from any other eye in the cluster as if that eye were her own, provided she is within 10 miles of that sensor. To recover a sensor, she can press a spy eye she holds from the same cluster against the one that's in sensor form to make the sensor emerge and return to marble form. A single bag of spy eyes contains five marbles (meaning that up to four may be deployed at any given time). Spy eyes in sensor form can be detected via the normal means for detecting scrying.]]></target>

A death bill is a +1 scythe that leaves particularly unsightly wounds in its victims' flesh-these wounds do not bleed, and have dry, flaking edges, almost as if the wound had been desiccated by desert winds. Three times per day, the wielder of a death bill can swing the weapon as a standard action to create a scythe-shaped arc of dust that sweeps out from the user in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in this area take 2d4 points of slashing damage plus an amount of additional damage equal to the user's Charisma modifier, and are staggered for 1 round by the pain of having moisture drawn from their bodies by the supernatural effect. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Once per day as a swift action, as a death bill is used to reduce a foe to negative hit points with a melee attack, the user may cast a death knell on that victim (Will DC 13 negates).]]></target>

A successful DC 15 Fortitude save made at the time the flaying strike occurs negates the bleed damage and staggered condition. The bleed effect can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or any spell that cures hit point damage. A flaying strike that results in a critical hit also deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage (no save) to the victim.

Once per month, the user can attempt to use a crystal ball of the dark void to contact a flying creature from the depths of space called a shantak (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 244).

The smell is undetectable by the skull's bearer, but companions and creatures within 30 feet find the pungent smell extremely noticeable.

The only way to remove the curse permanently other than giving away the skull is to use a miracle or wish spell, or to bury the skull in a forested area and keep watch for 24 hours.

During the time of Azlant, dozens of flamma horacalcums existed, each of which had to be encased in an orrery-like container made of horacalcum to prevent the flame from burning away into another time. The flame itself is weightless, but the orrery that contains it weighs 7 pounds, and requires a free hand to carry and utilize. As a free action, a flamma horacalcum's level of illumination can be adjusted by its carrier's thought to range from the brightness of a single candle to that shed by a daylight spell. This light is considered to be from a 9th-level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical darkness. Once the flamma horacalcum is set down, it continues to radiate its last level of light. This light bends and warps time in slight ways for its carrier, granting her a +4 bonus on all initiative checks. Three times per day, the flame can be commanded to cast a haste spell as a swift action. The carrier can also use the flame as a standard action to unleash a thin beam of fire equivalent to a searing light. A creature hit by this effect is slowed, as per the spell, for 1d4 rounds if it fails at a DC 20 Will save. Once per week as a standard action, the user of a flamma horacalcum can blow the flame out, snuffing it entirely. This triggers a time stop effect on the user that lasts for 1d4 rounds, after which the flame reignites. Other observers see this effect only as a brief flickering of the flame, since the duration of the time the flame was extinguished is contained wholly by the time stop effect.

                    <target><![CDATA[This simple-looking key seems to be carved crudely from stone, but is in fact a sort of skeleton key that can be used to wind all clockwork constructs swiftly and efficiently. Originally, the key allowed the carrier to command limitless numbers of clockworks simultaneously. With this key, Xin could command his entire clockwork army effortlessly, and its use was key to his power over Thassilon. But when Xin used it as an element in the clockwork reliquary's construction, the key's powers were vastly diminished. Xin accepted this as a necessity, since if all had gone according to plan, he would still be able to command his army using his new body. The diminished key can be recovered from the destroyed reliquary's remains. The guardian key can fit into any clockwork construct's keyhole, and fully winds a clockwork with a single turn made as a move action. Clockworks wound by the guardian key are healed of 5d8+20 points of damage, remain active for 10 times longer than they normally would, and during this period gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The guardian key can also be used to seize control of a clockwork. To do so, a creature must attempt a touch attack against the target clockwork as a standard action. If it hits, the clockwork can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist. If the clockwork's save fails, that clockwork regards the key's carrier as its creator, and follows that person's commands to the letter-provided the commands are spoken in Thassilonian. The guardian key can control only one construct at a time. If it is used to control a second clockwork, the previous one is released from its duties immediately.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The Sihedron is a seven-pointed star that symbolizes the power of Thassilonian magic. Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon, and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into its functionality significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal, and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought. Alas, Xin's ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the Sihedron. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon. The Sihedron itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals help to give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the Sihedron rune's distinctive hooklike shapes along its arms. In fact, these hooks are represented in the device by the placement of the seven ioun stone receptacles. Once the Sihedron is activated, it glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as if via a daylight spell. To activate the Sihedron, a person need only touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action-the Sihedron immediately rises up into the air behind the user's head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the Sihedron is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all ways treated as if it were an attended object being held or carried. The Sihedron implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way. Once activated, the Sihedron protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a foresight spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from ever being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the Sihedron can target its wearer with true resurrection the instant he is slain-he need not activate this power, as the Sihedron automatically triggers if the user is killed. When the user activates the Sihedron, he may select one of the star's points to be "ascendant." The Sihedron rotates so that this point is pointing upward, and he immediately gains an additional defense and the use of a spell-like ability, usable at will, as detailed below. The user may change which point is ascendant as a standard action by concentrating, but cannot change the point to an "oppositional" point. The effects granted by each of the Sihedron's points (as well as the two oppositional points for each) are listed at the end of this item description. As an immediate action (but no more often than once during any single combat round), the current user of the Sihedron may cause the artifact to instantaneously transfer itself to another willing creature within 120 feet. The Sihedron teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both of these creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws for 1 round and healing each creature of 2d8+10 points of damage. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but it must be made before the result of that role is confirmed by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature actually takes damage from any source, which could heal a heavily wounded target before the additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if the point selected is oppositional to the previously active point. Each of the Sihedron's arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the Sihedron is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant. Charity: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and dimensional anchor as a spell-like ability. Opposed by kindness and temperance. Generosity: Grants a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls and beast shape II as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and love. Humility: Grants a +8 insight bonus on skill checks and greater invisibility as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and zeal. Kindness: Grants a +4 insight bonus on weapon damage rolls and ice storm as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and zeal. Love: Grants a +8 insight bonus on initiative checks and charm monster as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and temperance. Temperance: Grants fast healing 10 (this replaces the standard fast healing granted by the Sihedron) and fear as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and love. Zeal: Grants a +8 insight bonus on concentration and caster level checks and dimension door as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and kindness.]]></target>

To use an attentive mirror, the owner must spend 1 hour gazing into the mirror in a ritual to attune herself to it. At the end of this time, the owner can willingly give the mirror to another creature. Thereafter, the creature that has the mirror can use it as an emergency means of communication with the mirror's owner. Up to three times per day, the mirror's possessor can open it to alert the attuned owner. This functions as a mental alarm with a range of 100 miles. The White Witches of Irrisen frequently provide attentive mirrors to their loyal minions and monstrous allies so the witches can be notified when their agents have important news. Once alerted, an attuned witch can then send aid or cast Irriseni mirror sight to view the situation through the mirror and receive a minion's report directly.]]></target>

It is believed that one of Irrisen's past queens originally forged Emberchill, and over the succeeding centuries, tradition has kept the weapon in the hands of the White Witches, such as its current wielder, Nazhena Vasilliovna. A spellcaster can store a single spell of any level with the cold descriptor and a casting time of one standard action in Emberchill. The wielder can use the stored spell to counterspell any spell with the fire descriptor, provided that the stored cold spell is 1 or more levels higher than the target fire spell (unless the cold spell specifically counters the fire spell). The wielder must still ready an action and succeed at a Spellcraft check to identify the spell to counterspell it. Once stored in the weapon, the cold spell cannot be used for any other purpose, but the wielder can harmlessly discharge the stored spell as a swift action to make room for another spell. Abilities that grant the cold descriptor to spells, such as the frozen caress hex of the winter witch archetype, make those spells suitable for storing within Emberchill.]]></target>

On command, an insidious bear trap snaps shut, opens to release a trapped creature, or resets itself.

In addition, the person setting the trap can effortlessly insert and withdraw the spike designed to secure the trap into the ground or even stone. Once per day, an insidious bear trap can be commanded to turn invisible for up to 5 hours or until triggered. While invisible, the insidious bear trap is virtually impossible to spot or disable (+40 to the DCs for Perception and Disable Device checks), though the person who set the trap can still see it. The trap receives no bonus on its melee attack roll. If a target of the trap has the trap sense class ability, it retains those bonuses to avoid the trap's attack. Additionally, once per day, an insidious bear trap can also be set to emit an audible alarm or mental ping, as per the alarm spell, when it is triggered.]]></target>

Creatures on the other side of a surface affected with smear of seeing cannot see the effect, but may detect it via detect magic or other effects as normal. Smear of seeing can be used on plaster, stone, wooden, or similar surfaces up to 10 feet thick. Smear of seeing has no effect on metal or harder materials, regardless of thickness. One application of smear of seeing is enough to cover a 1-foot-radius area; multiple applications can be used to increase the affected surface area.

When the command word is spoken, a toxin sponge can absorb a 10- foot cube of inhaled poison, removing the gas from that area and concentrating it in the sponge, which turns a pale green when filled. The sponge must be in the affected area of the poison gas in order to absorb it, and once it is absorbed, the duration of the poison effect (if any) is effectively paused. A toxin sponge can absorb either nonmagical poisons or magical poisons (and the poisonous effects of magical gases and mists) with a caster level of 9th or lower. A toxin sponge can absorb only one poison at a time; an absorbed poison dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. Alternatively, a creature can squeeze the filled sponge as a standard action before 24 hours have passed to release the noxious gas back into the air centered on the user. A creature may unknowingly activate a poison-filled toxin sponge during the course of regular bathing. Released poison takes up the same area it did when it was absorbed and lasts for the remaining duration of the poison when it was initially absorbed.]]></target>

A crude wooden spoon serves a bookmark. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes that allow an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells to augment her spells with specific metamagic effects through ritual preparation. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes for Ectoplasmic SpellAPG, Persistent SpellAPG, Rime SpellUM, and Sickening SpellAPG, and can be used to augment spells of 6th level or lower. Once per day, the spellcaster can augment a spell by following a recipe as part of her normal spell preparation. To prepare an augmented spell, the spellcaster must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 15 + spell level) while mixing the recipe's ingredients in a cauldron. (The cost of these ingredients is negligible, and they are assumed to be readily available in a spell component pouch.) If the check succeeds, the spell is augmented with the recipe's metamagic feat. This doesn't change the spell slot of the augmented spell. On a failed check, that spell can't be augmented that day, but the caster can attempt to augment another spell. A spellcaster can prepare only a single augmented spell each time she prepares spells, and apply only one augmentation from the cookbook to any given spell, but can combine an augmentation with metamagic feats she possesses. In this case, only the feats possessed by the caster adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. The book doesn't confer the associated metamagic feat on the owner, only the ability to use the given feat when spells are prepared.]]></target>

The ice blocks line of effect to the entrapped victim, who is helpless (but can still breathe) and takes 9 points of cold damage per round until freed. The ice has hardness 0 and 27 hit points; if the ice is broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with a successful DC 24 Strength check.]]></target>

In this area, temperatures drop to below freezing, winds blow at over 50 miles per hour, and heavy snow falls (see pages 438-439 of the Core Rulebook). It takes 10 minutes for the blizzard to form, and the conditions last for 1 hour before dissipating, at which point normal weather conditions in the area return.

When used as a climbing aid, an alpine ice axe grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to scale rock or ice walls. In addition, an alpine ice axe negates any Climb DC modifiers for climbing a slippery surface. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can strike an area of ice or snow with the ice axe to instantly create a series of sturdy handholds in the ice covering a distance of up to 40 feet. An ice wall with these handholds has a Climb DC of 15. An alpine ice axe is a tool, not a weapon, but it may be used as an improvised weapon with the usual -4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An alpine ice axe wielded as a weapon functions either as a +1 light pick when striking with the pick spike or as a +1 hand axe when striking with the adze blade. The ice axe uses the standard threat range and critical modifier for those weapons.

                    <target><![CDATA[This figurine of wondrous power is similar to a silver raven, but it can be used to send messages across the planes. On command, the figurine turns into a raven (retaining its stone-like consistency, which gives it hardness 8). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message as the sending spell (with no chance of the message not arriving). The recipient of the message can then use the obsidian raven to plane shift (self only) to the plane from which the message was sent. The figurine can be used in this way once per day. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special abilities, and it can maintain its non-figurine status for 24 hours per week (the duration need not be continuous).]]></target>

A rimeblade automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder, and if a rimeblade is damaged, the wielder can cause the blade to melt away and reform with full hit points as a full-round action. This ability cannot be used if the weapon is destroyed. Once per day on command, the wielder can transform a rimeblade into a beam of ice-cold flame called rimefire. The weapon is still wielded as scimitar, and attacks with the blade-like beam are melee touch attacks that deal 1d8+3 points of cold damage (regardless of the wielder's size). Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam is covered in clinging frost and is entangled for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form. In addition, once per day as a swift action before an attack, a rimeblade's wielder can cause the blade to glow with a pale blue radiance. On a successful attack, the rimeblade deals an additional 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead. This effect ends after a single attack, regardless of whether the attack is successful or not.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The Chronicle of the Righteous is the collected records of the good Outer Planes as written by the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to catalog the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The pages pertaining to the good Outer Planes lie within covers of beaten precious metals, bedecked with jewels of every color and inscribed with celestial iconography. Only a truly reverent individual, completely devoted to good, can open the Chronicle of the Righteous without an effort of will; for others, a successful DC 12 Will save is required to open the book. On a failed save, the individual decides she is unworthy of beholding the Chronicle and cannot attempt to open the book again for 24 hours. The Chronicle of the Righteous is written in Celestial. It details the geography of the good-aligned planes, the gods, empyreal lords, and celestial creatures who live there, and the unadulterated truths of these beings and their acts-truths that are sometimes heartening and at other times unsettling. Any evil-aligned creature who touches the Chronicle of the Righteous gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Nongood creatures attempting to read the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward good. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every conjuration (healing) spell and every spell with the good descriptor. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least 1 hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the good-aligned planes are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within those planes always brings the caster to the exact location desired. As long as the book is carried, the user is immediately aware of any action that might cause an alignment shift or a loss of standing with her deity, as if she wore a phylactery of faithfulness. The Chronicle of the Righteous is also surrounded by a permanent zone of truth, and creatures must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to tell a lie within 20 feet of the book. The bearer of the book casts all good spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with good creatures. Three times per day, the book can be used to cast one of the following spells: banishment, consecrate, greater planar binding, holy smite, holy word, sanctify weapons, and summon monster VII. Each time the Chronicle of the Righteous is referenced or used to cast a spell, there is a 10% chance that any empyreal lords on the same plane as the user instantly become aware of the book's precise location.]]></target>

When expanded, the orrery of distant worlds becomes affixed to whatever surface it sits upon, functioning as if anchored to that surface via an immovable rod. If consulted, it grants a +10 bonus on all Knowledge (geography) checks made to navigate or to answer questions about outer space. Once per month, it may be used to contact alien minds on far-flung worlds-this works identically to the spell contact other plane (use the demigod line to determine the effects of the spell or to determine ability score decreases). At your discretion, use of the orrery can have unanticipated results, as it can accidentally release stored information when activated (see area D7 on page 24 for an example of this event). The 11 planetary spheres and the sun sphere can be detached and carried separately. As long as even one of these spheres is missing, the orrery cannot be collapsed or moved, nor can it be used to contact alien minds. Once detached, a planetary sphere carries 4 charges that can be used to activate a spell effect. The effects of the 12 spheres and the number of charges required to use a sphere's spell are as follows: • Sun-searing light (1 charge) • Aballon-haste (2 charges) • Castrovel-detect thoughts (1 charge) • Golarion-resilient sphere (4 charges) • Akiton-rage (1 charge) • Verces-align weapon (1 charge) • Eox-death ward (2 charges) • Triaxus-teleport (4 charges) • Liavara-dream (4 charges) • Bretheda-restoration (2 charges) • Apostae-fly (2 charges) • Aucturn-confusion (2 charges) A sphere can be recharged by replacing it on the orrery, at which point it may be recharged by an arcane spellcaster in the same method by which a staff is recharged.]]></target>

Once a gas-trap cylinder is activated, it remains so for 10 minutes, and any creature composed primarily of air, fog, mist, or other vapor (including air elementals, hungry fogs, mihstus, trench mists, vampiric mists, and creatures in gaseous form) within 30 feet of the cylinder must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be sucked into the device, becoming trapped within.

Releasing creatures trapped in a gas-trap cylinder follows the same process as arming the cylinder. Arming the device requires a standard action, and the trapped creatures are released 1 round later. A gas-trap cylinder can also be perforated (hardness 10, hp 30) to release those trapped within. All of the creatures trapped within the cylinder are released at one time. Freed creatures are not under the control of the device's user and are free to act as they wish-often violently.

However, an enlarged creature doesn't gain the usual size bonus to Strength.

It functions as a +3 stone impactUE greataxe that automatically resizes to match the size of its wielder, from Small to Huge size. The hematite that composes the axe is as strong as iron, and doesn't have the fragile quality. Once per day, the labrys of the stone idol can be struck against the ground to create a powerful tremor, as the earthquake spell. When used in this way, the labrys creates a shield around its wielder, protecting him from the immediate effects of the earthquake, including fissures, falling rubble, and landslides. This shield disappears after 1 round, when the earthquake's effects end.]]></target>

A winter collector siphons a portion of the ambient cold weather and condenses it into concentrated cold energy, which the collector then beams like a signal across worlds to the winter receiver in the Royal Palace in Whitethrone. This energy then radiates out to the borders of Irrisen, keeping the weather in a perpetual wintry state. In addition, a winter collector functions as a permanent gate, allowing instant travel from the collector's location to the Royal Palace (but not in the other direction), even if the collector is located on the Material Plane. A winter collector radiates an aura o f cold out to 50 feet. This aura deals 6d6 points of cold damage each round to creatures in this area. Creatures within 10 feet of the winter collector take 12d6 points of cold damage each round. Half of this cold damage is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based effects.]]></target>

Its face constantly reshapes to form a relief of its bearer, and is capable of changing as quickly as two creatures can pass the wayfinder back and forth. The socket in which an ioun stone could normally be placed is instead filled with a permanently fixed gem that functions as a ring of minor spell storing. After wielding this wayfinder for 24 hours, its wielder can designate a series of conditions upon which the wayfinder will cast the highest-level spell stored in the gem with the wearer as the spell's target, as though it were using the contingency spell. For example, the wielder of a contingent wayfinder could place a cure moderate wounds spell in the wayfinder's gem, then specify that if she ever falls unconscious because of lethal damage, the spell must be cast on her. Once used in such a manner, the wayfinder requires 1 month to recharge its contingency effect, though a new spell can be cast into the enclosed gem at any time during this period. If the conditions of the contingency effect are not met within 1 week of when they were assigned, the user can change the conditions, though the spell stored in the gem can't be changed until it has been cast.]]></target>

Rather, if a piece of hair, a drop of blood, or some other organic matter from an individual creature is placed in the socket normally reserved for an ioun stone, the wayfinder's needle points out this creature as though it were the subject of a locate creature spell with a radius of 680 feet from the wayfinder's wielder. This effect has no set duration, and functions as long as a specimen of the target creature is held within the wayfinder and the creature is within range. If the target creature isn't in range, the headhunter wayfinder's needle slowly spins clockwise. As with the locate creature spell, running water and spells such as mislead, nondetection, and polymorph fool or otherwise block the effect. A headhunter wayfinder can't hold an ioun stone and doesn't provide resonant powers.]]></target>

In addition to the standard functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), a hypnotic wayfinder can be used once per day to mesmerize weak-minded creatures that can see it. When dangled by its fob and swung gently in a pendulumlike motion, the hypnotic wayfinder seems to change colors as light plays off its pearlescent exterior. This replicates the effects of hypnotic pattern (Will DC 13 negates), centered on the hypnotic wayfinder, but creates no visible light aside from the illusory color-shifts on the wayfinder itself. The wayfinder's wielder is immune to this effect, as are sightless creatures. While the effect is active, the wielder must remain stationary or the effect immediately ends. Otherwise, the effect lasts as long as the wielder swings the wayfinder at the end of its fob (a standard action) and for 2 rounds thereafter.]]></target>

Whenever the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder falls asleep, the roosters decorating the wayfinder change to crescent moons. Whenever a Tiny or larger creature comes within 20 feet of the wayfinder's bearer while she is asleep and this magic item is on her person, the noisemaker wayfinder immediately begins vibrating, buzzing, and ringing loudly as long as there is a clear line of effect between the wayfinder's bearer and the triggering creature. The sound from this effect easily travels 60 feet, as the audible alarm version of the alarm spell. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the wielder and assigned to the wayfinder before she falls asleep) does not set off the alarm. When the wayfinder's alarm is triggered, the violent motion of the noisemaker wayfinder continues until the wielder presses a button on the side of the device. If the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder is affected by a magical sleep effect (such as that caused by a sleep spell) and the alarm is triggered, the constant buzzing and vibration of the wayfinder allows the wielder to attempt a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves. Other sleeping creatures within hearing range of the wayfinder wake up from normal sleep, but not magical sleep. The bearer of a noisemaker wayfinder may disable its audible alarm function at will by pressing down on the compass needle.]]></target>

Prior to using the satchel, its bearer must place a blank book in the satchel and utter a command word. This blank book is sequestered in an extradimensional space accessible only upon command. (A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.) Once per day, when another book, folio, scroll, or other text is placed within the satchel while a blank book is hidden within the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly added book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain unchanged). The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on the pages of the blank book in the satchel's extradimensional pocket. The transfer takes 1 full round, and if the process is interrupted, such as by either book being removed or the satchel being significantly damaged, the text being copied is lost forever. If the blank book is smaller in size (in number of pages for a book or number of inches for a scroll) than the book to be stolen, the satchel doesn't transfer the contents, and the text being copied is lost forever. A book thief's satchel can't transfer magical writing (such as the pages of a wizard's spellbook, a magical scroll, or a wondrous item). Attempts to do so fail immediately, neither erasing the book to be copied nor copying any of the pages to the blank book.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[In 4692 AR, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a paladin of Iomedae and renowned demon slayer named Yaniel spoke out against the Mendevian crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the wardstone. Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword Radiance for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 ar, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with Radiance, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil. Radiance was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert. When handled by a paladin, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a +1 cold iron longsword that radiates light as a torch on command. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the paladin's deity's favored weapon (in the hands of a paladin who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains a +1 longsword). Certain events and tasks can awaken Radiance's latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger-these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur. In addition, Radiance is a legendary item (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 169) that bonds with a mythic paladin a s soon as it is wielded in combat-in this adventure, Radiance bonds if a paladin uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that recharge each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic paladin. As Radiance has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.]]></target>

The shard cannot be used to enhance ammunition in this manner, but can be used to enhance a weapon that fires ammunition; doing so causes the weapon to impart these qualities to the ammunition as it is fired.

                    <target><![CDATA[This banner, emblazoned with a good or lawful deity's holy symbol, is meant to be carried and displayed and has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. A bastion banner emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the banner. Within the 40-foot radius of its hallow effect, a planted bastion banner secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a bastion banner (such as with move earth or transmute mud to rock) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures). When planted, a bastion banner also has a specific spell tied to the hallow effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a bastion banner affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected. The spells and effects associated with each deity are: Abadar: Protection from energy (type is set when banner is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 sacred bonus on checks to aid another. Asmodeus: Cause fear (affects enemies only), and the hallow effect is unhallow instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat maneuver checks. Cayden Cailean: Remove fear; whenever allies successfully resist a fear effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour. Desna: Freedom of movement; once per day, whenever the banner's owner or an ally rolls a d20, the owner of the banner may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20. Erastil: Invisibility purge; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons. Iomedae: Death ward; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with melee weapons. Irori: Resist energy (type is set when banner is planted); allies gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves. Sarenrae: Daylight; all spells with the fire or light descriptor cast from within the affected area are cast at +1 caster level. Shelyn: Tongues; allies gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma. Torag: Dimensional anchor; allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC. Zon-Kuthon: Darkness, and hallow effect is unhallow instead; enemies are sickened.]]></target>

Once per day, the wielder of this dagger may slash herself, dealing damage as normal, but also channel some of her own blood into the tube, imprinting her memories onto the dagger. The imprinted blood lasts for a number of days equal to the wielder's HD plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). During this time, the dagger of repossession is typically given to an ally of the creature whose blood is imprinted. If the original wielder becomes possessed (such as by a ghost's malevolence ability or a magic jar spell) and she's slashed with the dagger again, the imprinted blood is consumed, the target regains her memories, and any possession effect immediately ends. A dagger of repossession does not end charm or compulsion effects, but the target receives another save against these effects at the original DC. Other mind-affecting effects are unaffected by the dagger. An imprinted dagger of repossession has no unusual effect if used on anyone other than the target whose blood is imprinted.]]></target>

This coating lasts 1 minute before dissipating. On a successful unarmed attack against a creature while both coated pins are held between the wielder's knuckles, the liquid flows under the skin of one of the target's limbs (wielder's choice; two limbs on a critical hit). The target must then attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, an affected limb becomes withered and useless, anything held in the limb drops to the ground, and the victim cannot move the limb for 5 minutes. If an affected limb contributes to one of the creature's modes of movement (such as a leg), the creature's movement is halved. A creature may be affected by multiple instances of deadlimb pins. Generally, a creature with both legs affected by deadlimb pins can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The exact consequences of applying multiple doses of deadlimb pins to creatures with inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion. In order to function, deadlimb pins must be used with the vial of liquid they were constructed with and vice-versa. One set of deadlimb pins and their adjoining vial can be used 50 times before its magic is depleted.]]></target>

A creature can spend 10 minutes and make a DC 15 Heal check to harvest the intact intestine, liver, lungs, or stomach from a Tiny to Large corpse and preserve it inside the jar. The corpse must be fresh (dead for no longer than 1 hour) and of the animal, dragon, or humanoid type. A full jar weighs 5 pounds. Up to three times per day, the bearer can gain any one of the following abilities that the creature possessed in life for 10 minutes at a value no greater than the creature had: climb speed, darkvision (up to 60 feet), resist energy, fly speed, low-light vision, scent, or swim speed. Movement abilities are limited to a speed of no more than 60 feet, and flight can be of no greater than good maneuverability. Energy resistance can be gained in any single energy type the creature was resistant or immune to, to a maximum of 20 points (if the creature had immunity, the user gains resistance 20 to that energy type). By expending one use of mythic power, the bearer can instead take the form of the creature for 10 minutes, as if using alter self, beast shape II, form of the dragon II, or giant form I, as appropriate. The bearer resembles the original creature as it appeared in life, as though he were impersonating that creature with a Disguise check result of 20. To use the jar's abilities, it only has to be carried on the bearer's person. In addition to these properties, the canopic jar preserves i ts contents for an indefinite period, similar to gentle repose. The organs are suitable remains for resurrection, but insufficient for raise dead.]]></target>

None is carved thicker than a finger, and their sides taper to form dull blades. Each is delicately carved with intricate, symmetrical designs of seemingly primitive origin. A long cord bound to the plank through a hole at the top of the blade allows the bearer to whirl the blade about in a circle, causing it to emit a low, growling tone with a strange warble that can be heard many miles away. In the hands of a mythic creature, whirling bullroarers can induce powerful sonic waves that trigger profound emotional reactions in anyone they touch. A mythic creature can attempt to spin up to two bullroarers at a time, provided he has a free hand for each. Spinning more than two bullroarers creates a cacophony that causes their effects to cancel each other out. The penetrating sonic waves don't need to be audible to be effective, however they can't affect creatures immune to mind-affecting effects. The bullroarers affect mythic opponents within a radius of 60 feet plus 10 additional feet per the tier wielder possesses, and non-mythic creatures within double that range. The effect remains for as long as the artifact's owner swings the bullroarer, up to a maximum number of rounds equal to his mythic tier. The individual blades and their powers are listed below. Blade of Courage: All allies within the area of effect are treated as if affected by of a blessing of courage and lifeAPG spell. Blade of Castigation: All opponents within the area fall to their knees as if affected by a castigateAPG spell. Blade of Despair: All opponents within the area of effect that hear the sound become saddened as if affected by a crushing despair spell. Blade of Fear: All opponents within the area of effect that hear the sound become frightened as if affected by a fear spell. Blade of Rage: All opponents within the area of effect that hear the sound become enraged as if affected by a rage spell.]]></target>

This 4-foot-long wooden pole is wrapped with three metal bands etched with elaborate cygnets and ravens-one band at the base, one in the center, and one shaped into a headpiece that forks into four sharpened tines. When recreating the ancient feasting ritual, which takes 10 minutes, a mythic creature can use the fleshhook to imbue the meat served upon its tines with his own mythic power. With each piece of meat served, the bearer can transfer one use of mythic power to the creature that eats the meat. If eaten by a mythic creature, the meat replenishes one use of mythic power. If eaten by a non-mythic creature, it grants a single use of mythic power for 24 hours. For as long as that non-mythic creature holds this use of mythic power, it's considered a mythic creature for the purposes of spells and effects, and gains both the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities. Once that use of mythic power is spent, the creature loses these abilities and is no longer considered mythic.]]></target>

This graft contains an imprisoned parasitic demon that can be satiated only by mythic power.

If placed upon the arm of a non-mythic character, the graft instead devours the limb, dealing 5d6 points of damage and amputating the arm. Once attached, the glabrezu claw surrounds its wearer with a field of force. This provides a deflection bonus to AC equal to the wearer's mythic tier. The wearer also gains immunity to electricity and poison. In addition, the wearer can feed the glabrezu claw some of his mythic power in order to activate spell-like abilities. All these spell-like abilities have a caster level equivalent to the graft wearer's total class levels plus his mythic tier. The graft wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain telepathy with a range of 100 feet for 2 hours (Bestiary 300) or cast any of the following spells: chaos hammer, confusion, dispel magic, mirror image, reverse gravity, or true seeing. By expending two uses, he can cast greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), veil (self only), or unholy blight. By expending three uses, he can cast power word stun or summon (level 4, either 1 glabrezu 30% or 1d2 vrocks 70%; Bestiary 300).]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This humble-looking, round-bottomed flask was used to purify one of the legendary philosopher's stones, and acquired some special properties as a side effect of this use. The hermetic flask and its creations function for only users with the alchemy class feature (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 26) and the ability to make extracts. Using the flask normally requires an alchemist's lab or crafting kit. Makeshift tools can be used, but result in a -5 penalty on all checks. If a user spends 10 minutes and 100 gp, and succeeds at a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check, the flask can distill one dose of alchemical essence. If the user expends one use of mythic power during the distilling process, 10 doses are made instead. Alchemical essence remains stable only as long as it's contained within the hermetic flask. As a standard action, an alchemist can pour forth a dose and immediately convert it into an alchemical item worth 100 gp or less, or into a poison worth 1,000 gp or less. He may throw it or apply it as part of the same standard action. A weapon-like liquid, such as alchemist's fire, congeals into a fragile globule and remains stable until thrown or otherwise broken. Any such substance poured from the flask remains stable for 1 minute, and then dissolves harmlessly. The purity of the alchemical essence increases the effectiveness of alchemical items derived from it. Any save DCs associated with the item increase by 2, and any damage caused or healed by it increases by 50% (including ability damage). The hermetic flask can hold a maximum of 10 doses of alchemical essence at a time. The user can identify the properties of an unknown alchemical substance or poison by pouring it into an empty hermetic flask and succeeding at a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check for a normal substance, or a DC 30 or 35 check for a rarer substance. This analysis takes 1 minute and doesn't destroy the substance. Poisons analyzed in the flask can be converted into an antidote as part of this check, consuming the poison in the process. Such an antidote automatically cures the poison in any creature currently suffering from it, and provides immunity to further exposure to that specific poison for 24 hours. The antidote remains stable for as long as it's within the flask, and for 1 minute after it's removed. By expending one use of mythic power and using the flask as part of a Craft check, the user can halve the cost of materials needed to create an alchemical item or poison. This doesn't apply to the creation of alchemical essence.]]></target>

When carried by a non-mythic creature, a nexus crystal bestows the ability to survive the conditions of a hostile plane as though the bearer were native to that plane. For example, the crystal would give immunity to the fires of the Plane of Fire and the life-draining radiation of the Negative Energy Plane. Any adaptation given protects only against the hazards of the plane itself, not the creatures within it-fire attacks from creatures on the Plane of Fire are still hazardous to the bearer. The crystal doesn't provide protection against extreme conditions not normally experienced by inhabitants of the given plane, such as the vacuum of space on the Material Plane. When carried by a mythic creature, a nexus crystal has the following additional powers. • As a standard action, the bearer can bestow the crystal's planar adaptation ability to another by touching the creature with the crystal and expending one use of mythic power. The protection can be withdrawn over any distance on the same plane with a standard action. The use of mythic power can't be recovered while the protection remains in place. If another creature claims the crystal and uses this ability, any protection bestowed by the previous owner immediately ends. • As a standard action, the bearer can use plane shift to move herself and up to seven other willing creatures to any plane she is familiar with by expending one use of mythic power. If traveling to a location she's already visited, she can reduce the inaccuracy of plane shift by expending two uses of mythic power when she does so, in which case she appears 1d6-1 miles (minimum 0 miles) from her destination. • As a standard action, the bearer can touch another creature with the nexus crystal and expend three uses of mythic power to use plane shift to move the target to a random plane (Reflex DC 27 negates). • As a standard action, the bearer can expend two uses of mythic power to create a widened dimensional lock centered on the crystal instead of on a point in space. The lock lasts for 24 hours or until dismissed. • As a full-round action, the bearer can attempt to draw back other creatures that teleported away by expending four uses of mythic power. If she succeeds at a DC 40 Knowledge (planes) check, the bearer can draw back up to one creature per mythic tier she possesses that departed via a conjuration (teleportation) effect in the previous round. To draw back a creature, the bearer must be within 15 feet of the location the creature left from. If the creature resists, it can attempt a Will save (DC 25 + the bearer's tier) to avoid returning. The bearer can choose freely which creatures from a group to pull back, and can even pull back creatures that departed with different means or to different destinations, as long as their points of departure are within range.]]></target>

While holding the rod, the bearer automatically perceives any spell cast (or spell-like ability used) within a 120-foot radius, even if she can't otherwise perceive the caster. Spells cast from spell completion and spell trigger items are automatically detected as well. The bearer immediately knows the specific spell cast, whether or not it was from a magic item, its level, the caster level, and whether the spell is arcane or divine. When the bearer of the rod of spell sundering counters a spell, she can counterspell with any spell of equal or greater level she's prepared, automatically countering as if she'd cast the proper spell to counterspell. As an immediate action after countering a spell, the rod's wielder can expend one use of mythic power to reflect the spell back on the caster. The rod's bearer must have line of effect to reflect a spell, unless the spell reflected doesn't require it. Treat the caster as the target, center, or origin of the spell's effect, as appropriate. Treat the spell as though cast by the rod's bearer on the caster. The power of the rod of spell sundering augments the spell, increasing the DC of any saving throws by 2 and the spell's caster level by the bearer's tier. When used as a weapon, the rod of spell sundering functions as a masterwork light mace. On a successful attack, it targets the creature struck with greater dispel magic, with a caster level equal to its bearer's character level plus her mythic tier.

                    <target><![CDATA[Similar to the staff of the magi, this long ivory staff is inlaid with platinum sigils and burns with eldritch fire when its powers are called upon. Unlike a normal staff, a staff of eldritch sovereignty holds 50 charges and can't be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, and others don't. A staff of eldritch sovereignty doesn't lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers don't use charges: • Arcane lock • Arcane sight • Daylight • Knock • Mage armor • Mage hand • Touch of idiocy The following powers drain 1 charge per use: • Black tentacles • Cone of cold (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half) • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 18 half) • Greater dispel magic • Greater invisibility • Greater teleport • Lightning arcUM (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half) • Major image (Will DC 18 disbelief) • Suggestion (Will DC 18 negates) These powers drain 2 charges per use: • Summon monster IX (the summoned creatures receive the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat) • Plane shift (Will DC 22 negates, arrive 2 to 200 miles from the intended destination) • Prismatic sphere (DC 24) • Prismatic spray (DC 22) For 5 charges, the staff of arcane sovereignty creates a gate. The staff of eldritch sovereignty has higher DCs than normal for a staff. The wielder still uses her own save DCs if they exceed those of the staff. The wielder can use any of her metamagic feats on spells cast with the staff of eldritch sovereignty by expending 1 charge per increase in spell level, with a minimum of 1 charge spent. The adjusted level of the spell can't be increased above 9th level. For example, a user with Quicken Spell can spend 5 charges to cast a quickened cone of cold with the staff, but couldn't use it to cast quickened greater teleport. The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefit of a number of charges equal to her mythic tier. Any excess charges are lost. For example, a 5th-tier wielder with Empower Spell could expend one use of mythic power to cast an empowered fireball without consuming any charges from the staff. A wielder who knows the mythic version of one of the staff's spells can cast such spells from the staff by expending one use of mythic power. This can be combined with using mythic power to provide charges. Finally, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to add 1 charge to the staff, with no risk of explosion if the staff is already fully charged. A staff of eldritch sovereignty gives the wielder spell resistance equal to 23 plus her tier. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can be used to absorb arcane energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough energy to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if the wielder had performed a retributive strike (see Destruction). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her—the staff doesn’t communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky. ]]></target>

If the wielder is non-mythic, each week he must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain that can't be healed until 1 week after he stops wielding the weapon. The witherfang then converts the stolen life essence into mythic power. A witherfang can hold a maximum of 20 uses of mythic power. A mythic character can use a witherfang's stolen mythic power to activate her own mythic abilities or to enhance the blade with the following abilities: bane, dancing, speed, and wounding. Each ability lasts for 24 hours, and only one can be applied to the blade within each 24-hour period. The wielder can increase the witherfang's enhancement bonus by 1 for each use of mythic power she expends. Alternately, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to imbue the blade with the bane special ability, two uses to imbue it with the wounding special ability, three uses to imbue it with the speed special ability, or four uses to imbue it with the dancing special ability.]]></target>

The Apocalypse Box appears subtly, sometimes as a dusty old box on a shelf or a forgotten heirloom in a grandparent's attic. A creature looking upon the Apocalypse Box is struck with a sensation of nearly overwhelming avarice, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be compelled to touch the box. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. If a creature touches the Apocalypse Box, she must succeed at another DC 30 Will save or fall under the box's curse. Cursed creatures are compelled to use any available means-including fleeing from or murdering friends and loved ones-to keep the box out of the hands of others. This curse can't be broken until the cursed creature dies or the box is destroyed. Additionally, if the cursed creature moves more than 10 feet away from the box, she immediately takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage each subsequent day until she and the Apocalypse Box are reunited. Only a creature bearing the Apocalypse Box's curse can open it. Once per day, the cursed creature can open the box and draw forth a single item her heart desires. The item must be nonmagical, weigh no more than 50 pounds, and be worth no more than 50,000 gp, but is otherwise limited only by the parameters of the wish spell. A mythic character can expend two uses of mythic power to draw forth a second such item each day. Each time the Apocalypse Box is opened, there is a 50% chance that instead of granting a wish, the box summons a number of horrific monsters that immediately attack anyone in sight and remain to wreak havoc on the Material Plane for 1 week before returning to their plane of origin. Roll on Table 5-1 below to determine the monsters that appear. The Apocalypse Box is quite tenacious in its desire for someone to open it. Each day, the cursed creature must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to open it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is initially 20, but increases by 2 each subsequent day the box isn't opened until the cursed creature fails the Will save, at which point she opens the box and the save DC resets to 20.

Closer inspection reveals it's actually a humanoid heart-frozen hard, solid, and covered in smooth ice. When clenched in a fist, it feels like it throbs, though the organ remains unmoving and unyielding to the eye. It's said to once have been the heart of a gelugon, and before that it was the heart of a human being. Staring at it causes the surface to gloss over with darkened ice and makes the observer's eyes swim. Once the holder knows to study it, the heart functions as a crystal ball with telepathy. The heart has a more sinister secret ability. With practice, mythic creatures can use the heart to scry more than just individuals, but entire settlements and cities. As the owner does, her mind becomes flooded with information about the region. Initially this knowledge consists of facts about population size, local economy, agriculture, leaders, and popular deities worshiped in the area. The owner feels a powerful desire to continue watching, and if she does so while taking no other breaks except to eat and sleep, the information continues unabated. Over the course of 1d10 days, the heart reveals much more: the subtle social, religious, and economic influences of the settlement; the strengths and weaknesses of its leaders; and all the many secrets both pedestrian and profane that could be used to manipulate and extort those with power over the location. At this point, the heart begins to communicate to its new owner, suggesting courses of action that would bring her a higher social station, wealth, and power in that area. The heart's advice is almost always sound, but also always driven toward an unfortunate and evil outcome for someone-just not necessarily its owner. If the owner refuses to heed its advice, eventually the heart vanishes, seeking a more pliant puppet to manipulate. Legends suggest that those who never question the heart's orders or decline its gift of knowledge eventually disappear to whatever cold place from which the heart originated.]]></target>

To activate the cauldron, a mythic creature must spill some of its own blood into the black basin as an offering of his mythic power. If the wound deals at least 4 points of damage, the cauldron drains one use of the individual's mythic power through it. Once activated, the cauldron fills with a strange red fog that remains for 1d20+10 minutes. During this time, mythic creatures can enter the cauldron and be transported to the crossroads. Non-mythic creatures that enter the cauldron take 4d6 points of damage per round until they climb out or die. The netherworld is small, with an overall area of 1 square half-mile. Highly mutable, the netherworld's appearance is determined by the will of whatever outsider currently waits there. Only one outsider can inhabit the netherworld at any given time. The specifics of what entity resides in the netherworld, as well as that entity's desire, change frequently and therefore are left to the discretion of the GM. Time in the netherworld passes out of sync with time in the Material Plane, thus a mythic creature can remain in the netherworld for as long as he wishes, and reemerges from the cauldron only a few minutes after his descent. The netherworld is a crossroads, coterminous with all planes. Outsiders can enter from any plane, but mortals can't travel to other planes from the netherworld.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A twisted blend of artifact, disease, and malign intellect, the Plaguebringer isn't so much found as contracted. Once it infects a host, Plaguebringer renders h im immune to the e ffects o f any lesser disease. Despite this immunity, the host can still spread disease; indeed, his body becomes an incubator for the countless ailments of the mortal world. When exposed to a disease, the host automatically fails any saving throw to avoid contracting it, but suffers no ill effects. The host indefinitely remains an asymptomatic carrier for any diseases caught. Plaguebringer also grants the following abilities: • The host receives a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, caster level checks, and saving throws. • The host generates an aura of unlife in a 30-foot radius. All living creatures other than the host within this radius take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. Undead creatures gain fast healing 5 that stacks with any fast healing they already possess. This aura can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action. • As part of using an ability that requires him to expend mythic power, the host can target a mythic creature within 30 feet. If that creature fails a DC 23 Fortitude save, it contracts a random disease (as contagion) and one use of its mythic power is stolen and granted to the host. If the host fails to steal mythic power, he must expend double the usual amount of his own mythic power or the ability fails. • The host can use contagion heightened to 8th level (DC 23) at will. • The host can use empowered vampiric touch three times per day. • As a swift action, the host can expend one use of mythic power to gain the effects of death ward, divine power, and spell resistance. These effects last 1 round per tier he possesses and can't be dispelled. • Once per day, the host can expend two uses of mythic power to summon a nightwingB2 to do his bidding for 1 hour. If the nightwing is slain, a new one can't be summoned for 1 week. Plaguebringer is intelligent, with an Intelligence score of 15, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 20. It has a neutral evil alignment, communicates by empathy, and has an Ego of 30. It exists only to spread disease and cause suffering. It protects and aids hosts that please it. If infecting a host who resists these goals, it withholds its abilities and attempts to control the host. Plaguebringer can take a single standard or swift action on its host's turn to activate any of its powers that don't require a touch attack. It has five uses of mythic power available to expend each day. It can use its host's own mythic power by becoming dominant (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 535). When infecting a host, it has full access to its host's senses, along with darkvision and blindsense with a range of 120 feet. When not in a host, Plaguebringer has only limited awareness, with hearing and blindsense usable to a range of 30 feet and no vision. When not infecting a host, Plaguebringer is undetectable by normal vision due to its microscopic size, though detect evil reveals its presence. It can fly at a speed of 30 feet, and can infect a new host by entering its body. If the target fails a DC 30 Fortitude save, Plaguebringer infects it and the creature gains access to the artifact's powers. If the target succeeds, Plaguebringer can't attempt to infect it again for 1 month. Plaguebringer can leave a host by becoming dominant and choosing to leave. Immediately after it leaves, the host is affected by multiple contagion effects (DC 30), one for each of the diseases listed in the spell.]]></target>

The scepter's other end curls and forms an eyehook, to which is tied a leather strap. Strung along this strap are four small, copper bells. Each bell signifies a single concept related to rulership: authority, banishment, dominion, and imprisonment. An individual seeking to wield the scepter must first bond with the artifact by permanently offering it one use of her mythic power. Thereafter, the owner must always keep one use of power unspent to maintain the bond. If the owner expends all her mythic power, the bond breaks and the individual can no longer access any of the scepter's power until she reestablishes her bond of ownership. Once bonded, the scepter can be wielded as a +6 brilliant energy light mace that grants a +4 enhancement bonus to its bonded owner's Charisma score. In addition, the owner can expend one use of mythic power and ring the scepter's bells to produce the following effects: • The wielder can ring the bell of authority to cast command targeting any non-mythic creature. • The wielder can ring the bell of banishment to cast dismissal upon any non-mythic outsider with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier. • The wielder can ring the bell of dominion to cast sanctuary on any non-mythic creature. • The wielder can ring the bell of imprisonment to cast forcecage on any non-mythic creature with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier. The caster level for all four effects is equal to the owner's total character level plus her tier. When she rings a bell, she can also expend an additional use of mythic power to increase the DC of the spell-like ability's saving throw by 10. Lastly, the owner can use the scepter to appoint a mythic agent to be a protector and advocate of the owner's people. When she does so, she bestows 1d4 uses of mythic power upon that creature that last for 1 month if the creature is mythic, or until they are spent if the creature is non-mythic. If the agent is mythic, these points increase the agent's maximum number of mythic uses for the month. If the champion is non-mythic, as long as that agent retains at least one use of mythic power, it gains the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities (see page 12).]]></target>

The heart seeks out the location of the nearest source of mythic power- either a creature or place-and when brought to the source devours its power. As soon as it comes within a 60-foot-radius of a mythic creature, it begins to leech off that creature's mythic power. Each round a mythic creature remains within the area of effect, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose 1d4 uses of mythic power. If the heart drains a mythic creature of all its daily uses of mythic power, the creature loses a mythic tier. The tier loss is semi-permanent, remaining until the creature successfully completes one trial.]]></target>

Though non-mythic creatures can board the ship as passengers, the Silver Maiden requires a mythic creature to be its captain. If the ship currently has no captain, a mythic character can claim the captaincy by touching the ship's wheel and stating her desire to be captain. The captain then serves until death or voluntarily retirement. Upon assuming the captaincy, the captain becomes aware of all of the ship's powers, and can propel the ship completely unaided from anywhere aboard the vessel, whether sailing the high seas of a terrestrial world or gliding through the vast blackness of deep space. At will, the captain can expend two uses of mythic power to launch the Silver Maiden into outer space. Once in space, the ship can sail through the vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a voyage between two planets within a solar system takes 2d20 days, and a voyage to another star system takes 2d20 weeks (or more at the GM's discretion). The captain must know which world she wishes to travel to (as if the captain cast greater teleport). When the ship arrives at its destination, it slowly descends to the surface (as the feather fall spell), and typically lands in a body of water. Once earthbound, the ship moves as a standard sailing ship. If the planet has no water or comparable liquid, the ship lands on solid ground and is unable to move until the captain once again launches the ship back into space. The Silver Maiden can also sail the Outer Planes. At will, the captain can expend three uses of mythic power to transport the ship to another plane, as the plane shift spell. When the ship arrives at its extraplanar destination, it appears in a body of water or comparable liquid, 1 to 100 miles from the captain's intended destination. If the plane has no water (such as the Plane of Earth) the ship appears on solid ground, and is unable to move until the captain transports it to another plane. If the plane has neither water nor a solid surface, such as the Plane of Air, the ship continues to slowly fall (as the feather fall spell) until the captain t ransports i t to another plane. The Silver Maiden protects its passengers from the environmental dangers of deep space and the outer planes, and can even sail the molten surface of a star. At all times, the ship simulates a comfortable temperature and gravity normal for its current captain's home world. This protection extends 10 feet from the exterior of the vessel.]]></target>

When toiling at the Trueforge, a mythic creature can create magical weapons and armor with a cost up to her mythic tier squared times 2,000 gp, ignoring the nonmagical cost of the item created. For example, a 10th-tier character could craft a magic weapon of a +10 enhancement equivalent, worth 200,000 gp plus the cost of the weapon itself. The item forged must be at least partially metal, such as a breastplate or spear. Creating such an item requires only half the usual value of raw materials. However, to create items involving exotic materials (such as adamantine), the creator must use and have access to the normal amount of the material. Regardless of the materials involved, it takes 1 day of labor to forge a nonmagical light or one-handed weapon, shield, or suit of light armor; 2 days to forge a suit of medium armor or two-handed weapon; and 3 days to forge a suit of heavy armor. For items with magical properties, square the number of days of labor and multiply by 1,000 to determine the total gold piece value. For example, completing an item with magical properties worth 144,000 gp or less requires 12 days of work. The crafter must labor continuously on the item, not sleeping until work is completed, though she's kept awake and vigorous through the magic of the forge. If the work is interrupted for more than 1 hour at a time or more than 2 hours in a single day, the item is ruined, and half the value of the raw materials wasted. In addition to making normal and magical weapons and armor, the Trueforge can repair a broken magic item, generally in half the number of days it would take to make it from scratch. It can even repair or create an artifact, though such a task requires months of preparation to gather the proper materials followed by weeks of labor at the forge. Only one person can work the forge at a time. As the crafter labors, the Trueforge feeds on her mythic power and life energy, drawing it into the item forged. Forging nonmagical items carries less risk. The crafter must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the start of each day of work or gain 2 permanent negative levels. For magic items, the save DC is equal to 25 plus the number of days worked thus far. At the start of each day of labor, the crafter must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the number of days worked so far plus one. If the crafter accumulates a number of negative levels equal to her own character level or exhausts her mythic power, the labor proves fatal at the end of the day. Normally, this ruins the work in progress, but if this occurs on the final day of work, the crafter finishes the item as she dies. Her soul enters the item, making it an intelligent item with the crafter's personality-and likely some of her abilities, as determined by the GM. Creatures immune to level drain, whether by innate nature or magical protection, can't use the Trueforge.]]></target>

The barding of pleated light grants additional powers related to the rippling light of an aurora. These powers can be activated by the wearer's rider; the wearer can activate the barding's powers only if it has an Intelligence score of 3 or greater. First, the barding can be activated as the blinding shield special ability at will, but the wearer and the wearer's rider are both immune to this blinding effect. Second, as an immediate action, the armor can be activated to divert harmful light or shadows. This grants the armor's spell resistance to the wearer's rider for 1 round, but this spell resistance only protects against spells with the light or shadow descriptor. Finally, the armor allows the wearer to pass through shimmering curtains of light. As an immediate action when charging, the armor can be activated to select any 10-foot-square area in the path of the charge. A curtain of multicolored light appears momentarily on each side of this area. The wearer can charge across this area as though it did not exist, disappearing into a ripple of light on one side and reappearing in a ripple of light on the other side. The wearer ignores terrain or obstacles in the intervening area (allowing the wearer to charge through allies in the area, for example), and the intervening area does not count toward the wearer's charge movement. The ripple of light cannot be used for movement by anyone except the wearer and the wearer's rider.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This ivory rod marked with nine special golden runes is an ornamental container for the true treasure sealed within- the broken thighbone of the unfailingly selfless Saint Argil. The rod cannot be opened except as part of the process to destroy it, as described below. When the Pauper's Thighbone is picked up, the new wielder immediately understands all of the powers and limitations of the artifact. When held like a rod, the Pauper's Thighbone can be used to enhance a spell with a metamagic feat the wielder already knows. The wielder can apply any one of her metamagic feats to a spell she casts without increasing the spell's casting time or the spell slot required. Enhancing a spell this way expends a number of the golden runes adorning the rod equal to the level increase of the spell normally required by the metamagic feat (for example, maximizing a spell with the Maximize Spell feat expends three golden runes). Enhancing a spell does not require an action and is performed as part of the casting time of the spell. Expended runes fade from bright gold to dull silver. Silver runes cannot be used to enhance spells, but they regain their golden color, and can be used again, at dawn each day. As the Pauper's Thighbone bears nine runes, it can be used to apply up to nine spell levels of increases daily. At the GM's discretion, if the artifact's owner intentionally ignores an opportunity to perform a selfless or generous act, one of the rod's runes flickers and permanently disappears, reflecting the paucity of the owner's soul. Inversely, if the owner of the Pauper's Thighbone performs a particularly generous act (such as giving away a large percentage of her wealth to the needy), an additional special rune might permanently appear on the rod. When possessed by an evil creature, the Pauper's Thighbone instead burdens its owner with the weight of his sins. In this case, the Pauper's Thighbone grants none of its powers and acts as a stone of weight. The rod can only be removed from an evil owner's possession if the owner dies or if the owner willingly gives the rod to a nonevil creature, and the nonevil creature willingly accepts it.]]></target>

Once complete, the recipient can make one hoof attack per round as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if it's a Medium creature or 1d3 points of damage if it's a Small creature, plus 1d6 points of fire damage. The brazen hoof leaves a scorch mark whenever the recipient walks on any surface with hardness 5 or less, but it does not set surfaces on fire.

Also, if the recipient is affected by any effect that is neither instantaneous nor permanent, it can attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end the effect.

A handful of blackblot can be thrown onto a creature as a splash weapon. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If the target takes a direct hit, it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be rendered immune to positive energy, similar to the protection death ward offers against negative energy. Spells and effects that heal or harm based on positive energy, such as cure spells and channeled positive energy, have no effect on the target. This effect lasts for 1 minute. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the blockblot hits must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be immune to positive energy for 1 round. A mythic creature that takes a direct hit from a dose of blackblot must attempt an additional DC 16 Will save. If the creature fails, it can't expend mythic power for 1 minute, though mythic abilities that don't require the expenditure of mythic power function normally. The mythic creature can attempt an additional Will save each round; if it's successful, this effect ends. Blackblot is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.

                    <target><![CDATA[This large bell appears to be cast from pure polished silver. It is engraved with delicate runes around the bottom lip, and measures 3 feet from lip to crown and 5 feet in circumference around the bottom. Sacred to the faith of Desna, seven such bells are believed to have existed at one point, each housed in a separate tower throughout the Inner Sea region. While these seven bell towers were separated by great distance, they represented the Seven Towers of Desna's palace, and pilgrimages to all seven were often undertaken by her faithful. Six towers are located in the western Mierani Forest of Varisia, the Hungry Mountains of Ustalav, the ruined city of Kokutang in the Sodden Lands, the eastern reaches of Tanglebriar in Kyonin, a hidden cove on Warlock Island in Cheliax, and somewhere in the hills south of White Canyon in Katapesh-over time, some of these locations have become quite dangerous. Each location presents its own dangers, and in some cases the bells themselves have gone missing. The seventh bell still hangs in its tower in an old fort in the eastern Stonewilds of the Worldwound. A Bell of Mercy's magic works only once per year, though it can be rung more often as a normal bell. When activated, the bell sanctifies the area around it with the effects of hallow with a 120-foot radius, and with the additional effects of protection from evil for every good-aligned creature within the area. Within a 60-foot radius, this also includes a chaotic good maximized forbiddance effect. Creatures whose alignments are not chaotic or not good take 36 points of damage (Will DC 19 half) upon entering this area, while creatures whose alignments are neither chaotic nor good take 72 points of damage. All evil extraplanar creature within 60 feet when the bell is rung must succeed at DC 20 Will save or be banished to their plane of origin-evil outsiders who resist this are still staggered in this area as a result of the bell's power. Finally, the immediate structure surrounding the bell becomes infused with magic, causing doors and walls within its forbiddance area to be magically treated (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 411) and repairing damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round. These repairs cannot repair damage to a structure incurred before the bell was rung. A Bell of Mercy is constantly under the effect of a dimensional lock, so it cannot be transported via teleportation.]]></target>

These devices are created by spellcasters who wish to control their own retrievers, since the secret of creating those monsters is beyond mortal capacity to understand. A retriever drone can be used to usurp control of a retriever that is within 30 feet. To take control of a retriever, the user of a retriever drone must have line of sight to the target and concentrate on it while holding the retriever drone in both hands. The target retriever can resist the attempt to take control by succeeding at a DC 16 Will save. If the retriever is currently on a mission to retrieve a target, it gains a +8 bonus on this save. If the retriever's saving throw is successful, the drone thrashes and scurries, making a single +15 bite attack (1d6+4 damage) against its carrier before becoming inert for 24 hours. If the retriever fails to resist, it falls under the control of the person who carried the drone-this control is permanent as long as the retriever drone exists and the person who activated the drone is chaotic evil. If the controller isn't chaotic evil, control granted lasts for only 24 hours. If the retriever controlled by a drone is destroyed, the drone itself crumbles to dust. As a full-round action while touching an active retriever drone, the user can look through the eyes of a controlled retriever and direct its actions. If the drone is destroyed while the user is linked in this manner, the user takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage (Fortitude DC 16 negates).]]></target>

Arrows fired from this bow trail streams of silvery light, and resemble shooting stars as they fly. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take these penalties for 1 round after being struck by such an arrow. An arrow shot from the starbow sheds light as a sunrod for 1 minute after it is shot. A starbow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder's Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can use a starbow to fire a 30-foot-long cone of arrow-shaped bolts of radiance. All creatures in the area of effect take 5d8 points of damage unless they are undead or creatures harmed by sunlight, in which case the damage increases to 10d8. This damage bypasses damage reduction and energy resistance. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. A creature that takes damage from this attack is shrouded with a soft radiance (as faerie fire) for 1 minute.]]></target>

A swarmlord's jar has a lid, but the lid is fused to the rest of the jar and cannot be opened. While a swarmlord's jar is carried openly in one hand, it grants a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws attempted against the attacks of swarms, and reduces swarm damage taken by the target by 5 points. These effects do not stack if more than one jar is carried. A swarmlord's jar can be thrown to shatter at any point within 30 feet. If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing swarm, it creates a locust swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 183) that follows the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action. If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm) is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the swarmlord's jar ends. A locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier. Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute. Used against a worm that walks, a swarmlord's jar merely deals 6d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack as it shatters (Will DC 15 half).]]></target>

This device functions as a crystal ball with telepathy and true seeing-a successful DC 24 Will save allows a creature to resist being scried upon by the imago lens. Once per day, the imago lens may instead be used to create a projected image of the user, as the spell project image. The user may project this image into any location she has observed before, either in person or via scrying. Once the image is projected, the user can sense the world around the image as if she were there, communicate with nearby creatures, and even cast spells. The image cannot move from its current location. Using this effect is not without risk; if the image is dispelled, the user must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain as her body reels from the sudden disconnection and her soul is warped and twisted by the lens's powerful magic. The imago lens is a chaotic evil artifact, and each time it is used, a non-chaotic-evil user must also succeed at a DC 25 Will save to resist having her alignment shift one step closer to chaotic evil.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Normally, when a demon lord is slain while its Abyssal resurrection ability has already been used, its body joins the countless others petrified into the walls of the Rift of Repose. The demon lord Nocticula discovered a method to bypass this, however, and now any demon lord slain by her is instead absorbed into her realm, creating an island in her domain. The demon lord's personality and themes influence the nature of the newly formed isle, but little of its physical form remains save for its ichor. This lifeblood fossilizes deep within the island into Nahyndrian crystals. The majority of Nahyndrian crystals are flawed, but the most perfect of them retain the mythic power of their demonic source. These Nahyndrian crystals have hardness 30 and 120 hit points, and can be used in the creation of various powerful items. Nahyndrian crystals feel cold to the touch, and contact with one can be debilitating. When a creature touches a Nahyndrian crystal, it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain as flashes of horrific anguish flood the creature's mind (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A creature can only be affected in this way by a Nahyndrian crystal once in a 24-hour period. A creature that carries a Nahyndrian crystal on its person (even if the crystal is carried in an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding) gains 2 negative levels; creatures with both the chaotic and evil subtypes only gain 1 negative level in this manner. These negative levels remain as long as the crystal is carried and are removed as soon as the crystal is abandoned. The negative levels from multiple Nahyndrian crystals stack. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the crystal is possessed (including via restoration spells). A creature who carries enough Nahyndrian crystals to gain enough negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice immediately dies-a humanoid slain in this manner immediately rises as an advanced bodak. A Nahyndrian crystal cannot be teleported. Anyone attempting to use a teleportation effect on a creature carrying a Nahyndrian crystal (including the creature itself) must attempt a DC 30 caster level check. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't work and is wasted; otherwise, the spell works normally, but any Nahyndrian crystals carried by the teleporter remain behind, dropping to the ground where the teleporter was previously standing.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This thick, syrupy, deep purple elixir contains within it the ability to infuse a drinker with a tiny fragment of a dead demon lord's mythic power. So potent is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold iron flask capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor-the flask itself is essentially a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with unholy energies that sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If the flask is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the flask is opened, the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points of unholy damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying the elixir. If a creature drinks a Nahyndrian elixir, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic ascension-gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a Nahyndrian elixir as nectar of the gods (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155). Nahyndrian elixirs have the same strange immunity to teleportation effects as Nahyndrian crystals.]]></target>

Attached to the front of the chair is a 12-foot-long, hollow mithral cylinder wound with a fine braid of incredibly thin copper wire and set at a variable angle to allow it to be aimed like a siege weapon. At the cylinder's end is a small clamp designed to hold a large crystal through which the cannon's beam travels, acting as a focal lens. Once per week, the quake cannon can be activated to create an earthquake effect (as the spell) centered on any point within 50 miles. Activating the cannon takes 10 minutes, and a diamond worth at least 10,000 gp must be used as the device's focal lens. This diamond is expended in the process of firing the weapon. If an eidite gem worth at least 5,000 gp is instead used as a focal lens, the quake cannon does not create an earthquake at the targeted location, but instead fires an ultrasonic pulse that affects only clockworks within the same area of effect as the cannon's normal earthquake effect. Any constructs with the clockwork subtype in the affected area must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be overwhelmed with electromagnetic impulses and ultrasonic disruptions. Clockwork creatures that fail their saving throws against this effect become confused for 1 minute. During this time and for 24 hours afterward, affected creatures are compelled to move toward the quake canon as fast as they can. This is a sonic effect.]]></target>

Once per day, a spellcaster may activate her caster's tattoo as a swift action to automatically enhance the next spell she casts in that round with both the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats. When she casts the spell, the caster's tattoo flares with light for a moment, then grows faint and faded-it replenishes its energy in 24 hours, after which it becomes bold and colorful and can be used again. Required material components or foci must be in the creature's possession to cast the spell (and are consumed as normal), but need not be held when the spell is cast. Caster's tattoos are available in lesser, standard, and greater versions, allowing the modified casting of a spell of up to 3rd level, 6th level, or 9th level respectively.]]></target>

These tattoos appear as colorful and intricate patterns rather than magical writing. The tattoo is a silent, spell completion item that only the bearer can activate. It vanishes when activated. A spell tattoo must be visible to the bearer and must be touched as part of its activation. These magical tattoos are not normally placed on the head, neck, or back as a result, since most creatures would require mirrors to activate them. A spell tattoo's aura and caster level varies as per the scroll it emulates. A spell tattoo has a market price four times as much as an equivalent scroll.]]></target>

Once per day, the wearer can create a wall of stone up to 2 inches thick and 45 feet long (or 90 feet long, if the thickness is reduced to 1 inch). For the purpose of this effect, the bracelets of stone count as a stone surface that the wall of stone can merge with, and they magically provide the wearer the strength necessary to support any wall of stone so created. Thus, the wearer can create a bridge or wall in nearly any location as long as he is standing adjacent to a point where the bracelets can connect to it. If the bracelets are used this way, the wearer can't move from this space and is considered flat-footed during this time, but may end the effect as an immediate action (thus destroying the wall). If either bracelet is taken off or a portion of the wall is breached or destroyed, this effect immediately ends and the wall of stone crumbles to dust.]]></target>

This small blue gem is imbued with the power to capture a spell and make it available for later use. Once activated, a spell-capturing gem waits indefinitely for its owner to successfully counterspell a spell by using either dispel magic or other means. The gem's owner may then choose to capture the foiled spell in the gem, where it remains for a number of days equal to the owner's caster level minus the spell's spell level, minimum 1 day. (For example, if a 10th-level spellcaster successfully dispels and captures a fireball spell with this item, the spell could remain in the gem for up to 7 days.) At any time during that period, the wielder of the gem may use it to cast the captured spell, regardless of whether she would normally be able to do so. A spell cast in this way uses the minimum caster level necessary to determine all level-dependent effects. A spell-capturing gem is a single-use item. Once the captured spell has been released or once the storage duration of the gem is reached, the gem loses its sheen and turns gray, becoming a worthless pebble.]]></target>

For those who can afford them, clockwork prostheses-miraculous metallic extremities fused with a small amount of primal magic-offer an elegant solution to missing limbs. Once purchased, a clockwork prosthesis is attached to the area where a limb once was-a prosthesis can't be added in addition to an already existing limb. Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with clockwork prostheses, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a clockwork prosthesis is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery. Clockwork prostheses commonly come in two types-arms and legs. Clockwork Arm: A clockwork arm allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum load over his head. A humanoid with two clockwork arms can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. In addition, a clockwork arm allows its bearer to deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike and provides a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that hand. For the appropriate price, a clockwork arm can be enchanted with any weapon special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks. Clockwork Leg: A clockwork leg allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two clockwork legs can lift up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition, each installed clockwork leg grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against trip and bull rush attempts. The clockwork prostheses detailed here are only the most common types of clockwork prostheses. Other, more specialized clockwork prostheses capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even channeling magical energy are also rumored to exist.]]></target>

The bug can record up to 1 hour of sound, which must be continuous; if the recording is stopped early, it cannot be restarted. Making the clockwork bug replay the recorded audio is a swift action. Once a gemstone is imprinted with an audio recording, it cannot be reused, and must be replaced with a fresh gemstone in order for the bug to make a new recording. Replacing a gemstone is a full-round action that requires a DC 25 Disable Device check. Failing this check causes the used gemstone to become cracked and erases any recorded sounds on that gemstone. Though a clockwork bug isn't treated as a creature and cannot move or perform other actions by itself, it can cling indefinitely to any surface onto which it is placed, including the underside of objects. These bugs are also equipped with a timer that can delay the start of recording process by up to 24 hours. Additionally, the bug is equipped with an optional self-destruct timer with a maximum duration of 72 hours. If engaged, the self-destruct sequence causes the bug to erase any information on its current gemstone and then send a surge of energy through its filaments, rendering itself useless and irreparable.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This +1 scorpion whipUE is made from the tail of a giant cave scorpion. Three times per day, it allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 15) upon a creature struck by the whip. The wielder can decide to use the power after she has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the whip strikes. In addition, the fleshwarped scorpion's tail can be attached to (or removed from) a willing or helpless creature with 1 hour of surgery and a successful DC 20 Heal check. Whether or not the surgery is successful, the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. While the tail is attached, the creature gains a natural sting attack that deals damage as the fleshwarped scorpion's tail (including the enhancement bonus and ability to use the poison effect three times per day). The save DC for the poison effect becomes 10 + 1/2 the creature's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[A silhouette of a miniature Varisian dancer graces the center of this simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed music box trap that is not currently storing a spell. Thereafter, when the music box trap is opened and allowed to play for 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round delay, the spell is discharged with no effect. The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a charm person spell successfully delivered onto a target from a music box trap makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone. There is no obvious indicator that the music box trap delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target. Closing the music box trap is a move action. If the music box is closed before its stored spell is delivered, the spell remains stored within the music box trap to await the next creature to open the box.]]></target>

Made of shimmering mithral and studded with dozens of rubies, the Chalice of Ozem was carried from the ruins and handed down through generations until it was finally given to Iomedae, who used it in her fight against Erum-Hel during the Battle of Three Sorrows. The chalice cannot be harmed by any substance it holds, no matter how caustic. Further, any liquid placed within the chalice will never spill unless the chalice's carrier wills it. If the chalice is held and the command phrase spoken ("Ozem for Iomedae!"), it projects a globe of invulnerability. If a second command phrase is spoken ("Her sheltering shield!") and a scooping motion is made with the chalice, a resilient sphere is created around the carrier. Each of these effects can be called upon twice per day. Once per day, a mythic character can expend one use of mythic power while pouring a dose of holy water into the chalice to immediately transform that dose of holy water into a single dose of nectar of the gods ( Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155).]]></target>

These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they can't be overcome in any way so long as the heart is carried, with one exception: a worshiper of Iomedae can cast atonement on the heart to suppress this effect for 24 hours. Once per day, by squeezing the heart in the hand as a standard action, the user can cause all good outsiders within 60 feet to take 1 point of Constitution bleed. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this effect. At the start of each round, a target may attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to end the effect.

Favored by Osirian men and women alike, nonmagical kohl is applied around the eyes and is used to reduce the glare from the desert sun, and cosmetically to cause the whites of the wearer's eyes to stand out distinctly. When applied to the eyes, kohl of uncanny discernment grants its wearer low-light vision and a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks. If the wearer already has low-light vision, the kohl doubles the distance the wearer can see. The wearer also gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks, patterns, visual effects, and sight-based attacks. These effects last for 1 hour. Applying the kohl is a full-round action, and it must be applied to both eyes to function. An unopened tube of kohl of uncanny discernment contains 5 applications.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This mummified house cat-dried, filled with sand, and bound in linen wrappings- appears to be nothing more than a family pet buried alongside its deceased master. Far more than a mere pet, however, a mummified guardian protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a mummified guardian also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as sanctify corpseUM. In addition, the mummified guardian also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the mummified guardian is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the mummified guardian retains only its sanctify corpse ability (this reduces the price of the mummified guardian to 3,000 gp). If the sarcophagus containing the mummified guardian is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the mummified guardian. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration. A mummified guardian must be placed inside a sarcophagus, coffin, or other enclosed container with a dead body to function. Although cats are most common, mummified guardians can be created from the mummified remains of other small animals as well.]]></target>

Originally created by priests of Nethys for use by their temple guards, a spear of the watchful guardian also grants its wielder arcane aid to strike true. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of a spear of the watchful guardian can alter the physical properties of the weapon, allowing it to bypass damage reduction of one of the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, silver, or slashing. This change lasts for 5 minutes. In addition, if the wielder of a spear of the watchful guardian fails an attack roll, as an immediate action once per day, she can retroactively add a +1 competence bonus on that roll. If this bonus is enough to make the failure a success, the attack roll succeeds. Finally, a spear of the watchful guardian sharpens the senses of its wielder, granting her a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Fashioned from granite, this stone tablet is approximately 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and just over an inch thick. Dating to the period of the Keleshite Interregnum in Osirion over 2,000 years ago, the tablet was once part of a larger stone stele that was publicly displayed for all to see. Now known as the tablet of languages lost, the broken slab is inscribed with a vow of fealty to the Padishah Emperor of Kelesh in three different languages: Ancient Osiriani, Kelish, and contemporary Osiriani. The characters and hieroglyphs of the three languages correspond to one another and serve as a translation key between the languages. Once per day, upon speaking the command word, the owner of the tablet can read and understand any written texts as if using comprehend languages for a period of 30 minutes. This does not allow the owner to speak or write unknown languages, or read magical writings (though the tablet reveals that such texts are magical). In addition, if the tablet is readily available and at hand, the owner gains a +3 competence bonus on all Linguistics checks. Finally, if the owner knows at least one of the three languages inscribed on the tablet, he can attempt Linguistics checks to translate the other two languages even if untrained in the Linguistics skill. Possession of the tablet of languages lost serves as an acceptable rationale for the owner to learn one of the three languages inscribed upon it (by putting a rank in Linguistics during character advancement) without the need of a teacher or library. Although the tablet of languages lost was created to ease the transition of native Osirians from pharaonic rule to that of a foreign monarch, other tablets could exist bearing different messages in other languages.]]></target>

The rift works in a similar fashion to a gate spell; however, some of the ethereal plane leaks into the surrounding plane, creating a strange ethereal mist. The artifact can be manipulated to control the speed, strength, and direction of the current. Settings Static: The current remains stationary. Once this state is triggered, the mists fill with ghosts and spirits of the departed. An individual who stands within the cage can speak with the departed and ask them questions. This power works as speak with dead. Output: The ethereal mist flows in a current that draws living things into the ethereal plane, as the telekinesis spell (CL 18). Input: Ethereal mist rushes from the cage, erupting into the area in great ghostly tendrils. Lashing frantically, they discharge bolts of supernatural cold into all living creatures they touch. Creatures from the ethereal plane can freely travel into the plane when the cage is activated. The input state is a protection, predominantly used to ward off enemies seeking to steal or tamper with the device when its owner is traveling the ethereal plane.]]></target>

Ten pawns (two sets of five) carved from petrified wood are stored within the box. The top of the box serves as the game board, with three rows of 10 squares each. Two characters can play the game against each other, or a single character can play against the game itself, which animates to play against its opponent. While a mundane senet game emulates the journey into the afterlife, a game of fortunate passing exerts genuine influence over a player's fate-it's said that a winner the protection and favor of the gods of Ancient Osirion. A game of senet takes 30 minutes to play. At the end of this time, the players make opposed Intelligence checks; whoever wins the check wins the game. If playing against the game itself, the game has an effective Intelligence bonus of +4. Winning a game of senet with the game of fortunate passing(either against another player or the game itself) charges one of the game's pawns with magic. For the next 24 hours, the winner gains a +2 luck bonus on skill checks and saving throws against fear and death effects. Once used, a pawn loses all magic, becoming a normal playing piece. A game of fortunate passing has 10 pawns; once all 10 pawns have been used, theitem becomes a mundane senet game set.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Carved from gold and inlaid with cobalt, lapis lazuli, and onyx, this elaborate funerary mask was crafted for the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I, and was intended to be interred along with his mummy in his tomb. Upon Hakotep's death, the Nethysian sect called the Sacrosanct Order of the Blue Feather trapped a portion of Hakotep's soul-his ka, or "vital spark"-inside the mask and stole it from the pharaoh's tomb. To conceal this crime, the Order of the Blue Feather hid the mask (which came to be known as the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh) beneath the Sanctum of the Erudite Eye in Wati, where it was found millennia later by the necromancer Nebta-Khufre. Empowered by Hakotep's ka, the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh is a powerful artifact. When worn, the mask occupies both the head and headband magic item slots. After 24 hours, the mask attunes itself to its wearer, granting its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to one of his mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). The wearer chooses which ability score is enhanced the first time he puts on the mask. If the mask grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants ranks in skills as a headband of vast intelligence: first in Knowledge (nobility), then, as the bonuses increase, in Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion). Once the mask is attuned to a wearer, the enhanced ability score cannot be changed unless the mask attunes itself to a new wearer (which takes another 24 hours). In addition, the mask provides its wearer with deathwatch as a constant spell-like ability. The mask cannot be detected by any sort of divination magic, and grants its wearer a constant nondetection effect. Once attuned, the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh has additional powers based on its wearer's alignment. If worn by an evil character, the mask enhances the wearer's control over undead, doubling the number of undead the wearer may control with animate dead, control undead, the Command Undead feat, and similar effects. Additionally, the wearer can cast animate dead once per day as a spell-like ability. If worn by a good character, the mask grants its wearer immunity to disease, including supernatural diseases such as mummy rot. In addition, the wearer can cast death ward and speak with dead each once per day as a spell-like ability. A neutral character who is neither good nor evil must choose to be treated as either good or evil when he first dons the mask. Once made, this choice cannot be reversed. A neutral character who uses the mask to create undead gains 1 permanent negative level for each Hit Die of undead created. These negative levels cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells), but they are immediately removed if the undead creatures are destroyed. The Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh reveals additional powers as its wearer increases in levels. At 7th level, the mask's enhancement bonus to a mental ability score increases to +4. Also at this level, an evil wearer can cast create undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast eyebite once per day instead. At 11th level, the mask's enhancement bonus increases to +6, an evil wearer can cast control undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast finger of death once per day. At 15th level, an evil wearer can cast create greater undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast symbol of death once per day. Legends hint at unspeakable rituals that can use the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh to create a "ka pulse," channeling the energy of Hakotep's fractured soul to animate huge numbers of undead creatures in a wide area, though doing so is rumored to destroy the wearer's own ka, thereby denying the wearer access to the afterlife and enslaving his will to that of the Forgotten Pharaoh.]]></target>

It appears similar to the funerary figurines called ushabti frequently found buried with the deceased in Osirian tombs. Upon command, an ushabti of the willing servant conjures a ghostly attendant that performs simple duties or manual labor at its owner's behest, as an unseen servant. The ghostly attendant remains for 1 hour at a time, and cannot move farther than 30 feet from its ushabti. If the ushabti's owner inscribes his or her own name on the figurine (which requires a successful DC 10 Craft [sculpture] or [stonecarving] check), the ushabti of the willing servant gains an additional power. While it can still summon an unseen servant, the owner can command the ushabti to instead summon a ghostly warrior to fight and defend its owner. This warrior functions as a spiritual ally (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 246) armed with a flail for 7 rounds. Once an ushabti of the willing servant has been used to conjure a spiritual ally in this way, the ushabti loses all of its magic, becoming only a mundane figurine.]]></target>

The black onyx gem on its own is worth 50 gp as a spell component for animate dead and similar spells. If the black onyx is used as a material component in a necromancy spell, the bearer of the white onyx receives a mental alarm. This alarm reveals the direction of the paired black onyx gem as long as it is within 1,000 feet, as locate object. This effect lasts for 5 minutes. If the owner of the white onyx gem is within 1 mile of the black onyx at the time the necromancy spell is cast, the owner may destroy the white onyx as a standard action. Doing so also destroys the black onyx, making it unsuitable for use as a spell component and ruining the necromancy spell. The destruction of either onyx gem immediately ends the alarm and locate object effects. The white onyx turns gray and crumbles to dust after the locate object effect ends. More expensive sets of these gems exist; black onyx gems in such variant sets are worth up to 1,000 gp or more. The value of the black onyx gem is added to the item's construction cost.]]></target>

Chewing a piece of poison gum-which resembles nothing so much as a lump of congealed sap-is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, though the user can continue to chew the gum as a free action on consecutive rounds. Doing so fills the user's mouth with three doses of Medium spider venom (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560). This poison lasts for up to 5 minutes before losing its potency. As a swift action while chewing poison gum, the user can apply the poison to a wielded weapon. If the user lacks the poison use class feature, there is a 5% chance that he exposes herself to the poison while chewing the gum or applying the poison to a weapon, and if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon, he also exposes himself to the poison.]]></target>

When inactive, a safecamp wagon looks like an elaborately carved wooden toy wagon, 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches tall. On command, the toy transforms in a single round into an open-topped wagon (Core Rulebook 163). A second command word creates a canvas top supported with a sturdy wooden frame over the wagon. A third command word causes wooden panels to extend down and outward from the wagon, forming a stable wooden platform extending 5 feet in all directions from the wagon's base, suitable for walking, sitting, standing, or sleeping upon. A sliding wooden door in the back panel allows access to the space under the wagon. Speaking the command word again causes these panels to retract into the wagon. A fourth command word returns the wagon to its toy shape; any items on or in the wagon are carefully placed on the ground around the toy. A safecamp wagon cannot transform if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy at full size. In any form, the wooden parts of this item have hardness 8, the canvas parts have hardness 2, and the entire object has fire resistance 5.]]></target>

This love takes the form of time spent caring for the doll, keeping it on one's person, and preventing any harm from coming to it. In order to use the accumulated power within a Zonzon doll of forgiveness, the owner must give the doll to the creature that it resembles. Depending on how long the doll's owner took care of it, the doll may bestow up to three cumulative effects. Each benefit lasts 24 hours unless otherwise noted. If the doll is gifted after 1 day of care, it grants the owner a +5 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks against the creature that the doll resembles (hereafter referred to as the target creature). If the doll is gifted after 1 week of care, the owner can use the Diplomacy skill to shift the target creature's attitude closer to helpful by up to three steps (exceeding the normal two-step limitation) and takes no penalty for failing a Diplomacy check by 5 or more. Finally, if the doll is gifted after 1 month of care, the recipient of the Zonzon doll may activate the doll within 24 hours to gain the benefit of an atonement spell. After the doll has been gifted and the duration of the effect expires, a Zonzon doll reverts to a normal rag doll with no magical powers.]]></target>

A bottle of shifting sand can be thrown as a splash weapon targeting a specific grid intersection (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 202). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If thrown on an earthen or sandy surface, the bottle breaks, creating an area of churning, shifting sand in a 20-foot spread that obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a -5 penalty. Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the affected area must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must succeed at a second Reflex save or fall prone. At the end of 5 rounds, the sand disappears, leaving no aftereffects. If a bottle of shifting sand is thrown at a creature, a direct hit instead throws up a cloud of whirling sand that surrounds the creature. This cloud of sand provides concealment to the target and any creatures in adjacent squares for 1 round, but has no effect on the surrounding terrain.]]></target>

With a successful DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check, a character identifies the figure as Anubis, the Ancient Osirian god of burial, funeral rites, mummification, and a protector of the dead and their tombs. Once per week, an effigy of Anubis enables its possessor to use speak with dead and ask up to six questions. The effigy must be placed within the rib cage of a corpse, and the corpse's answers come through the effigy- the jackal's mouth moves with the words. The corpse must still be mostly intact and have a mouth for the spell to work. In addition, an effigy of Anubis can be used to bring a dead creature back to life, though Anubis, as god of the dead, is willing to grant only a temporary reprieve from oblivion. Breaking the figurine reveals a hollow interior filled with diamond dust. If this diamond dust is sprinkled on a corpse that has been dead for less than 48 hours, the creature comes back to life as with temporary resurrection (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 243). This effect lasts for 24 hours, at which point the creature dies again. Once used in this way, an effigy of Anubis loses all of its magic and is destroyed.]]></target>

The priesthood of Wadjet is credited with creating the first rods of the uraeus, but others have since replicated the feat. A rod of the uraeus can be wielded as a +1 light mace. When holding the rod, the wielder gains a +2 resistance bonus on Reflex saves and a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks. The wielder can fire a 30-foot line of stinging poison from the rod up to twice per day (once for each head of the uraeus). A creature in the area of effect can avoid the poison with a successful DC 13 Reflex save. On a failed save, a creature is blinded and paralyzed for 8 rounds. Each round on its turn, an affected creature may attempt a DC 13 Fortitude save to end the blindness and paralysis effects. A rod of the uraeus functions only if its possessor is lawful.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits for a short period while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When the candle is lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke. At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak. A grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead, save that the dead spirit takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can be subjected to the effects of a grave candle only once-the burning of a grave candle effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the candle.]]></target>

The decks sport a stylized image of an eye on the back of each card-one deck's eyes are red, and the deck's eyes are blue. Each card in the red deck is linked to its corresponding card in the blue deck. The owner can peer through the eyes of any card from the red deck to see whatever is in front of the corresponding blue-eyed card, as if using enter image (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 219). The owner can peer through any red card at will; drawing a random card and peering through it is a standard action, while going through the deck and selecting a specific card is a full-round action. If the corresponding blue card is still shuffled in with the rest of the blue deck, it is automatically moved to the top of that deck, ready to be drawn by whoever bears it. Once a blue card is drawn, it can be placed on a creature's person with a successful Sleight of Hand check or stuck to any sturdy flat surface, where it remains until moved again by either you or another creature. Only a single pair of cards can have a visual link between them at any time, and placing a red card at the bottom of its deck causes the eye on the matching blue card to close, ending the visual link until the red card is peered through again. While the blue cards can be meted out and separated however the owner desires, the red cards lose their magic if separated from the red-eyed harrow deck for more than 10 minutes. If a blue card or a red card is destroyed, the matching card of the opposite deck loses its magic.]]></target>

When the sentinel is active, its eyes shine with green light and a triangle of runes on its chest glows silver. Close examination and a successful DC 25 Perception check reveal a secret catch that opens a hatch in the statue's back. Anyone who crawls inside finds seating for one Medium or Small occupant and eight unlabeled levers and pedals. These controls allow a character inside to activate and control the sentinel's movements and actions. Operating a lever is normally a move action, but operating the lever to extend or retract the sentinel's arms (such as to attack) is a standard action. No lever can be operated more than once per round. Lever (d8) Lever Function 1 Uncover/cover forward porthole 2 Uncover/cover side portholes 3 Extend/retract arms 4 Close/open hands 5 Move forward/backward 6 Turn left/right 7 Open/close eyes with continual flame inside 8 Open/close hatch The sentinel's hands can grasp objects as small as Fine in size, and can make slam attacks. Although the sentinel cannot swim, it can function in water up to 900 feet deep. If its portholes are covered, it holds enough air for a Medium operator to survive 1d4+1 hours. When active, a bronze sentinel has the following statistics: Size Large; AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural); hardness 15; hp 150; Speed 20 ft.; Melee 2 slams +12 (2d6); CMB +14; CMD 24.]]></target>

If the spell is successful, the outsider leaves behind a small pile of magical ashes and the phlogiston vial cannot be used to banish outsiders again until the oil inside is replaced as a standard action (see below). If the ashes are collected and placed inside the vial, and the vial is used as an additional material component for a planar ally spell, the spell conjures the exact same outsider, provided the creature is a viable target of that spell. The owner of the vial receives a +4 bonus on her Charisma check to negotiate with the creature. The ashes are consumed after an agreement with the creature is made. A phlogiston vial is a single-use item that can be recharged with a rare alchemical agent called phlogiston oil, which can only be found on the Plane of Fire and costs 2,000 gp when sold on the open market. The listed price is for a phlogiston vial full of phlogiston oil.]]></target>

If the target fails at a DC 19 Reflex save, the sandstorm dust catches on the creature and grows to the size of a small sandstorm.

While the target lands on its feet each time, this does not prevent it from being dropped off a cliff or onto a dangerous patch of terrain. The affected creature can attempt to arrest itself as a move action with a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check or DC 19 Reflex save; success means that the creature is not flung into the air that round.

First, anytime the owner's equipment is targeted by heat metal, the effect is automatically countered as if the snowfall orb had cast chill metal. Second, once per day, the owner can concentrate on the orb for 10 minutes to alter the weather in a 1-mile radius. Doing so causes snow, heavy snow, sleet, or hail (user's choice) to fall within that radius for 1d4 hours, regardless of the environment's predominant climate or season. This ability otherwise functions as control weather. Finally, the user can throw a snowfall orb at an opponent as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 20 feet. On a hit, the orb is destroyed and the target immediately takes 5d6 points of cold damage.

When lit, the candle transmutes its material composition from wax into gleaming divine ice (frozen holy water like that produced by holy iceUM). The flame of the candle is cool and radiates violet-blue light. Lighting the candle is a standard action, and anyone adjacent to it can extinguish the flame as a free action. The candle can burn for 10 rounds (need not be consecutive) before the ice is entirely consumed. While the candle is burning, it emits an aura of divine cold in a 30-foot radius. The candle modifies the effect of any channeled positive or negative energy that originates inside the aura, and of any cure or inflict spell cast inside the aura. Instead of their normal effects, these abilities deal an amount of cold damage equal to the number of hit points they would normally cure or inflict. A target that succeeds at a Fortitude save (using the normal DC for the ability or spell) instead takes half damage. A bearer can hurl the lit candle at an enemy as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, causing the candle to explode into a burst of chilled holy water. A creature struck in this manner is numbed by divine cold, becoming staggered for half the remaining time that the candle could burn (Fortitude DC 17 negates). An undead creature or evil outsider struck in this manner also takes 1d4 points of damage for each remaining round that the candle could continue burning, as if it were hit by holy water (no saving throw).]]></target>

This command must consist five words or fewer, such as, "Never attack me again!" or "Never cast an enchantment spell!" or "Don't set foot in Sothis!" Once the imperative is uttered, the wound caused by the hit glows with faint golden light, as does the blade of the axe. This glow persists even after the damage is healed. The imperative lasts until one of two things occurs. It ends if the wielder utters another imperative (only one imperative can be in effect at a time), or if the target creature attempts an action that would break the imperative. When the target takes that action, it takes damage as if struck with a successful critical hit by the wielder of the axe of the imperative. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates this damage. When this occurs, the wielder immediately knows that the target broke the imperative. A lingering imperative can be removed without harming the target as if it were a curse effect. The imperative is a sonic language-dependent effect.]]></target>

If the carrier is undead, the life lantern instead sheds an area of magical darkness akin to that exuded by a darkness spell. The light or darkness exuded by a life lantern enhances certain elements of necromancy. In an area of light generated by a living carrier of a life lantern, dying creatures gain a +4 bonus on all Constitution checks to stabilize. More significantly, a body brought back to life via raise dead, resurrection, or any similar effect does not gain any negative levels upon being brought back, as long as the body is restored while it is illuminated by the life lantern's light. Once per year, the life lantern may be used by a living creature to cast resurrection on a creature by touching the life lantern to a portion of the dead creature's body. When the life lantern sheds darkness in the hand of an undead creature, all undead creatures in that area of darkness gain fast healing 5. Once per week, the life lantern may be used by an undead creature to cast create greater undead. The life lantern also functions as a holy or unholy symbol for a spellcaster who worships a deity who grants access to the domains of Death or Healing, and the spellcaster need not actually have those domains to use the lantern in this way.]]></target>

A rod of the devoured dawn can be wielded as a +1 heavy mace. When holding the rod, the wielder gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. Once per day, the rod can create a shadowy hypnotic pattern that also functions as dispel magic and targets any spells with the light descriptor in the area of effect. When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a rod of the devoured dawn on a Medium or smaller foe, the head of the rod animates and grants an automatic grapple check against the creature struck (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity). If the grapple check is successful, the rod's jaw unhinges and expands momentarily to swallow the creature, gulping it into a flesh-walled extradimensional space. The swallowed target gains the grappled condition and takes 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage per round on its turn. The creature can cut its way out (AC 14, hp 24) or wriggle out with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check as a full-round action-either method of escape causes the victim to be disgorged from the rod into an adjacent space. The rod automatically disgorges a swallowed victim if the swallowed creature dies or if the rod is destroyed. Only one creature can be swallowed at a time. A rod of the devoured dawn only functions if its wielder is chaotic.]]></target>

It is carved into the shape of a highly stylized, blossoming lotus. The stone's greatest power lies in its ability to restore life to any individual that has been deceased for fewer than 48 hours. To perform the resurrection ritual, the tablet must be placed the upon the individual's chest at dusk; when the first rays of the rising sun to touch the deceased individual's face, he awakens. During the ritual, the deceased person experiences a powerful vision in which he enters the divine court of Namrut, a blue-skinned Osirian man with lotus flowers blossoming from his head and palms. Hundreds of white and blue lotus flowers float in the pools that line the stone pathways of Namrut's courtyard. Namrut offers the individual the blessing of life; in return he asks that he not be forgotten. If the individual accepts, Namrut graciously returns him to life per resurrection. When the individual wakes, he discovers that the back of his neck has been marked with the symbol of Namrut's white lotus. The marking is permanent and cannot be removed by any means short of a miracle or wish. Thereafter, provided the individual keeps his promise to remember Namrut, the lotus grants the marked character a number of spell-like abilities. A number of times per day equal to 1 + the marked character's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), the marked character can perform a lotus ritual to simulate the effects of one of the following spells: cure critical wounds, neutralize poison, remove blindness/deafness, remove disease, or restoration. Performing the lotus ritual requires a full 10 minutes of prayer, during which the marked individual can not be interrupted. In addition to prayers, the ritual requires the consumption of lotus tea.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[Omat's Sarcophagus is similar in appearance to the sarcophagi used in the burial rites of many ancient pharaohs. It is constructed from wood, and its surface is sealed with pitch and set with an alternating pattern of scaled bands carved from lapis lazuli and jasper and scribed with thousands of protective hieroglyphs. All other exposed surfaces are gilded. Although this item appears to be a normal sarcophagus, it has a number of special powers. Each of these effects can be used once per day, and they affect only creatures of the humanoid type. If a humanoid that has been dead for less than 1 month is placed inside Omat's Sarcophagus and the lid is sealed, the corpse's soul is forced into the sarcophagus and trapped there. The corpse then disintegrates and the sarcophagus begins building a new young-adult body over the course of 2d12 days. This effect occurs even if the original creature had reached the end of its natural life. The body created is free of all physical ills and afflictions that the creature may have previously suffered. Once the new body is complete, the soul is then forced into the new body and the being awakens in the sarcophagus. If the sarcophagus is destroyed before the soul can be united with the newly formed body, the soul is once again released to the afterlife. If a living creature is placed inside Omat's Sarcophagus, it can use the device to travel to the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or Pharasma's Boneyard. To activate this teleportation power, a creature must be inside the sarcophagus with the lid closed. The user must then recite aloud the sacred poem of Neb-Aku (which is inscribed on the interior of the sarcophagus's lid) in Ancient Osiriani. The recitation immediately opens a portal, and the user can then move through the portal to the desired plane (chosen after reciting the poem). The sarcophagus doesn't confer any abilities that protect the user while on another plane. For up to 48 hours after using Omat's Sarcophagus to travel to another plane, the user can utter a command word to be immediately transported back to the sarcophagus. After this time passes, the user must find her own way back to the Material Plane.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[The Sistrum of Bastet is a powerful artifact that, when used properly, allows a bard to use her bardic performance ability to enhance the spells of a divine spellcaster or conceal her true motives. Once per day, when the wielder uses the Sistrum of Bastet as part of a bardic performance, she can inspire a divine spellcaster within range of the performance and bolster the effects of any spells that spellcaster casts. Thereafter, for the duration of the performance, whenever the designated divine caster chooses to cast a spell, the bard can expend 1 or more rounds of bardic performance as an immediate action to enhance her allied divine spellcaster's spell as if that individual had prepared it with the Heighten Spell Metamagic Feat. The number of levels by which the divine spell is heightened is determined by the number of rounds of bardic performance sacrificed. For example, if the sistrum's player sacrifices 2 rounds of bardic performance, the divine caster's spell level increases by 2. A spell's level can never increase beyond 9th level, and can't be higher than the divine caster can cast. Second, a bard wielding the Sistrum of Bastet can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, the bard can combine her casting time for a spell with a Perform check. Observers must succeed at a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by the user's Perform check to realize she is also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of her bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time. In addition, a bard using the Sistrum of Bastet can select a number of creatures equal to her level. The bard can deliver secret messages to these individuals without needing to use the Bluff skill. The bard still must be able to speak to deliver the message. Finally, when the wielder gains a bard level and is able to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, she can choose a spell from the cleric spell list. This spell must be of the same level as the spell that she is replacing, and the bard casts that spell as a divine spell. If the Sistrum of Bastet ever leaves her possession for longer than 24 hours, any divine spells added in this way are lost unless she can reclaim the instrument.]]></target>

Upon command, it expands to a length of 6 feet and can be wielded as a double weapon that has a +4 enhancement bonus. The head deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and can be used to make trip attacks, while the forked end deals 1d6 points of piercing damage. The wielder can use either end as the primary weapon, with the other becoming the off-hand weapon. Though it is formidable in melee, the scepter's true value lies in its ability to allow its wielder to claim dominion over specific areas, people, reality, and even time. As a move action, the wielder can plant the scepter's forked end into the ground to activate a 120-foot aura of dominion. The aura remains active so long as the scepter remains there. The wielder can then concentrate to manipulate the aura to produce various magical effects. The wielder can produce only a single effect at a time, and each new effect requires a new action. The effects are as follows. • At will, the wielder can use a standard action to manipulate the aura to emulate the effects of either sanctuary or protection against chaos. These effects include all willing creatures within the aura of dominion. If the wielder activates the sanctuary effect (DC 15), all allies within the aura are subject to the usual terms of the spell. If any allies break the spell's terms, the effect immediately ends for everyone affected. • Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can manipulate the aura to block any extradimensional travel within the aura of dominion. The area within the aura is treated as if under the effects of dimensional lock. • Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can manipulate the aura to force extraplanar creatures entering the aura of dominion to return to their home planes immediately, as if targeted by a banishment spell. Up to 40 Hit Dice of creatures can be affected by this effect, and creatures subject to this effect can resist with a successful DC 21 Will save. • Lastly, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can alter time within the aura of dominion. The wielder can use time stop and include a number of people in the effect equal to 1 + the user's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Unwilling creatures can resist this effect with a successful DC 23 Will save. Those affected by the time stop can interact with each other as normal, and individuals are not restricted from leaving the aura of dominion while the effect is in place.]]></target>

Unlike normal canopic jars, a canopic jar of unlife is used to preserve the existence of a powerful undead creature. When a corporeal undead creature is first created, one of its organs must be placed inside the canopic jar of unlife as part of the ritual that transforms the creature into an undead being. Thereafter, the undead creature's existence is linked to the canopic jar of unlife. If the undead creature is destroyed, the canopic jar of unlife disintegrates 2 hours later, and the viscera within the jar start to regenerate into a new undead body for the subject at a rate of 10 hit points per hour. The subject is helpless until restored to full hit points. Once used to regenerate an undead creature, a canopic jar of unlife is destroyed. If the jar is opened manually after viscera are secured in it, the contents disintegrate with an ear-piercing scream and the jar loses all magical power. Smashing the jar (hardness 8, hp 20) also destroys the vessel and the viscera within. A canopic jar of unlife only functions if linked to an undead creature during its creation; existing undead creatures or creatures with phylacteries (such as liches) or with the rejuvenation ability (such as mummy lords) cannot make use of a canopic jar of unlife.]]></target>

The chariot of the conqueror is a light chariot pulled by a team of two ghostly manticores controlled by beaded reigns. The manticores can only draw the chariot; they cannot attack or otherwise act. The chariot's statistics are Hardness 10, hp 180, Base Save +2, Maximum Speed 200 ft., fly 200 ft. (perfect); Acceleration 100 ft., fly 100 ft.; all other statistics conform to those of a standard light chariot (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 181). The chariot of the conqueror treats all terrain as normal, including water-the vehicle glides smoothly over liquid as though it were pavement-and can even fly. On command, the chariot can drive itself for up to 1 hour with a +20 bonus on drive checks, following the driver's verbal orders. Otherwise, the driver must attempt driving checks to control the ghostly steeds drawing the chariot as normal (Ultimate Combat 170). The chariot of the conqueror can carry up to two Medium creatures: one driver and one passenger. Creatures riding in the chariot gain a +4 cover bonus to AC. Passengers balance perfectly while riding in the vehicle, even if it's moving sideways or upside down, making it a perfect platform for archers or others making ranged attacks. Damage to the chariot can be magically repaired, but if reduced to 0 hit points, it's destroyed.]]></target>

Once per day, the bearer of the scarab can speak with vermin as if using speak with animals, though the information obtained is very limited. If the bearer has the wild empathy class feature, she may use it to influence vermin as easily as she influences animals. Once per day, the bearer can cast summon swarm to summon as warm of scarab beetles (treat as a spider swarm, but instead of poison, the swarm causes filth fever).]]></target>

These are placed within a hollow figurine typically made of gold, jade, or gemstone that, when completed, has hardness 5 and 5 hit points. If the sovereign shabti still exists when the bound individual dies, its magic takes effect. The figurine's power speeds the spirit along the River of Souls, assuring it safely reaches the Boneyard. The soul is judged 2d12 hours after dying, at which point the figurine expels its power to create a new being, a living 1st-level shabti duplicate of the bound individual. If the soul was condemned to torment or labor, the shabti goes in its place-the bound individual's spirit traveling to some favorable corner of a plane matching her alignment. If the soul was to be rewarded, the shabti appears on to the fringes of Axis. Once the shabti has been created, the bound individual cannot be returned to life by any means short of divine intervention. The sovereign shabti-which does not travel with the bound soul-crumbles as soon as it creates a shabti.]]></target>

Once per day on command, the cube disintegrates into a cloud of countless Fine flying constructs that resemble mechanical fireflies. These fireflies cluster and flutter about in a 60-foot-radius spread around the user, homing in on Tiny or larger masses of metal and illuminating them as though the objects emitted candlelight. The fireflies continue to highlight metal objects for 5 minutes before swarming back into cube-form in the user's hand. Creatures in the area wearing metal armor are illuminated as if by faerie fire. Creatures in the area wielding metal weapons are dazzled as long as they are within range of the mechanical fireflies and continue to wield the weapons. The mechanical fireflies glow different colors depending on the type of metal they touch, though the item bears no indication of which colors correspond to what metals, so the user must figure out the fireflies' code to glean any useful information from it.]]></target>

                    <target><![CDATA[This tiny copper statue of a featureless, dancing humanoid is sometimes awarded to the winners of contests at Pitax's Academy of Grand Arts. The power of a player's prize comes not from possessing it, however, but from giving it to an unsuspecting audience member. By inscribing a personal rune on his player's prize, a bard can cause whoever carries the item (knowingly or not) to be more susceptible to his bardic performances. Once inscribed, a player's prize can not be keyed to any other creature. Devious bards use Sleight of Hand to drop their player's prize on rivals' or foes' persons, usually in a backpack or in among other gear where it would be difficult to locate. A creature carrying a player's prize keyed to a bard within 30 feet takes a -2 penalty on Will saves against that bard's bardic performances, as well as a -2 penalty on opposed skill checks against any skill checks the bard attempts using his versatile performance class feature. These penalties remain as long as the affected creature continues to carry the player's prize. Once per day as an immediate action, the character whose personal rune is inscribed on the player's prize can speak the item's command word to cause the statue to instantly appear in his hand. The character must be within 30 feet of the player's prize to activate this ability.]]></target>
